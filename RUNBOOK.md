        ├─ ensure-disk (optional) ─► build or verify golden disk on ghost hostPath
        ├─ provision-vm           ─► reflink golden disk into a per-run KubeVirt VM
        ├─ run-gnome-tests        ─► runner pod clones repo, SSHes VM, executes qecore + behave

```

Two steady-state execution paths exist:

| Path | Purpose | Persistent state |
|---|---|---|
| Titan fast path | Test-only iteration against always-on VMs | Titan disk under `/var/home/jorge/VMs/titans/...` |
| Fresh VM path | Image and golden-disk validation | Golden disk under `/var/tmp/bluefin-golden/<tag>/disk.raw` |

## Cluster topology

| Host | Role | IP | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ghost | k3s control-plane + KubeVirt compute | 192.168.1.102 | Runs VM workloads and Argo control-plane services |
| exo-1 | k3s worker | 192.168.1.239 | Workflow pods only |
| Argo UI | external entrypoint | http://192.168.1.102:32746 | Host-local service also exposed on port 2746 |
| Loki | log aggregation | http://192.168.1.102:30100 | Captures workflow pod logs |
| ArgoCD | GitOps controller | https://192.168.1.102 | Reconciles this repo into the cluster |

All KubeVirt VMs are pinned to ghost. Workflow pods may land on ghost or exo-1 depending on template constraints.

## GitOps ownership

| Area | Source of truth | Reconciler |
|---|---|---|
| WorkflowTemplates | `argo/workflow-templates/*.yaml` | ArgoCD application `testing-lab` |
| Cluster infra and CronWorkflows | `manifests/*.yaml` | ArgoCD application `testing-lab-infra` |
| Operator entrypoints | `Justfile` | Local operator / MCP tooling |

The repo is intentionally GitOps-first: cluster state should converge from git, not from manual template applies or node SSH.

## Operator access model

- Use Kubernetes MCP and Argo MCP for workstation-side cluster reads and mutations.
- Prefer the `just` entrypoints when they exist; they are the human-facing wrappers around the same API-driven workflow.
- Do not SSH from a workstation into `ghost` or `exo-1` for inspection, recovery, or file transfer.
- In-workflow SSH into test VMs and probe-pod-to-titan SSH remain valid because they originate inside the cluster and are part of the test harness, not node administration.

## Image, disk, and VM model

| Object | Backing location | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Golden disk (`latest`) | `/var/tmp/bluefin-golden/latest/disk.raw` | Fresh-VM pipeline | Built by `bib-build-and-push` |
| Golden disk (`lts`) | `/var/tmp/bluefin-golden/lts/disk.raw` | Fresh-VM pipeline | Built by `bib-build-and-push` |
| Titan Bluefin disk | `/var/home/jorge/VMs/titans/titan-bluefin/image/disk.raw` | `titan-bluefin` | Persistent fast-path disk |
| Titan LTS disk | `/var/home/jorge/VMs/titans/image/disk.raw` | `titan-lts` | Persistent fast-path disk |
| Per-run hostDisk clone | `/var/tmp/bluefin-golden/*-runs/...` | Provisioned fresh VMs | Removed by teardown or orphan cleanup |

The SSH secret lives in the `bluefin-test-ssh-key` Kubernetes secret in namespace `argo`.
Golden disks can be patched by workflow after key rotation; titan disk key refresh is intentionally human-gated. <!-- TODO: replace with MCP tool when available -->

## Test execution stack

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `git-sync` initContainer | Clone the requested repo ref into the runner pod |
| `run-gnome-tests` | Copy suites to the VM and orchestrate execution |
| `qecore-headless` | Start the Wayland GNOME session inside the VM |
| `dogtail` | Traverse and interact with the AT-SPI tree |
| `gnome-ponytail-daemon` | Translate AT-SPI coordinates into Wayland input |
| `Shell.Eval` | Handle GNOME Shell 50 top-bar interactions that AT-SPI cannot drive reliably |
| Loki | Preserve logs and emitted test artifacts after pod cleanup |

## GNOME Shell 50 constraints

- Clock, quick-settings, and calendar interactions are not reliably actionable through AT-SPI alone.
- `global.context.unsafe_mode = true` must be enabled before top-bar interaction.
- `findChild(..., requireResult=...)` is not a supported dogtail pattern in this repo's stack.
- `findChildren(...)` and `findChild(..., retry=False)` are the canonical presence-check APIs.

## Common failure modes

| Symptom | Root cause | Durable fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Permission denied (publickey)` during SSH wait | Golden disk or titan disk contains an old public key | Re-patch or rebuild the golden disk; escalate titan key refresh to a human operator |
| Workflow hangs before GUI steps start | VM boot or SSH readiness never completed | Inspect VMI readiness and runner logs, then re-run the appropriate recovery path |
| `TypeError` involving `requireResult` | Stale dogtail step pattern | Replace with `findChildren(...)` or `findChild(..., retry=False)` |
| Clock / quick-settings scenarios miss their targets | GNOME Shell AT-SPI geometry gap | Drive the interaction via `Shell.Eval` |
| `outputs.result` contains debug text | Script template wrote extra stdout | Send debug output to stderr and reserve stdout for the actual result |
| VM stuck `Terminating` | KubeVirt controller race with launcher cleanup | Delete the `virt-launcher-*` pod and let reconciliation finish |
| `run-gnome-tests` pod fails at startup | Workflow template structure error, often misplaced `volumes:` | Fix the template in git and let ArgoCD reconcile it |
| WorkflowTemplate change appears ignored | Workflow was submitted before the new template was reconciled | Verify ArgoCD revision, wait or sync, then submit a new workflow |
| Auth probe returns 200 without credentials | `REQUIRE_AUTH` env var not injected into the fixture pod | Confirm `auth-mode=true` was passed to the workflow; check `kubectl describe pod` env section |
| `test_authenticated_returns_200` fails with connection error | TLS cert generation step failed or secret not mounted | Inspect `create-secrets` step logs; confirm `homelab-access-tls` Secret exists in the run namespace |
| Auth tests get 421 instead of 401 | Host header mismatch — runner is using the pod IP instead of `homelab-access.local` | The fixture validates `Host:`; ensure `TEST_HOSTNAME` is unset so the default `homelab-access.local` is used |
| `www-authenticate` header missing from 401 response | Fixture server code path not reached (connection refused or wrong port) | Check that `homelab-access` Service exposes port 8443 and the pod is Ready before tests run |
| Auth artifact files absent after run | Runner pod did not reach the test step (deploy-fixture failure) | Inspect `deploy-fixture` step logs for rollout timeout; check pod events in the run namespace |
