# Lab — Agent Entry Point

This repo is the infrastructure for automated Bluefin testing: Argo Workflows,
ArgoCD, KubeVirt, and the manifests that run the lab test cluster.

## Start here

1. Read this file.
2. Find the skill for the area you need in [`docs/skills/README.md`](docs/skills/README.md)
   and load only that skill.
3. For deterministic commands, check the [`Justfile`](Justfile) or
   [`docs/reference/agent-cheatsheet.md`](docs/reference/agent-cheatsheet.md).
4. For operational failure modes, read [`docs/ops/RUNBOOK.md`](docs/ops/RUNBOOK.md).
5. Before changing anything, check the latest project context in
   [`docs/reference/ubiquitous-language.md`](docs/reference/ubiquitous-language.md).

## What this repo is

- **Factory** — the org-wide OS delivery system across `projectbluefin/bluefin`,
  `bluefin-lts`, `dakota`, and `common`, plus their CI pipelines.
- **Lab** — this repo's QA cluster. Lab data supplements factory data on the
  dashboard and is always labeled as lab-sourced, never as factory health itself.
- **Lane** — a `(variant, branch)` pair such as `bluefin-testing` or
  `bluefin-lts-stable`; the unit of tracking.
- **Release verdict** — per-lane judgment of the latest published digest:
  **good** iff the build succeeded, the lab QA pipeline passed against that
  digest, and cosign signature verification passes. New CVEs are displayed
  alongside the verdict but do not gate it.

## Build / test / lint

```bash
just lint              # actionlint + argo lint + registry allowlist
# dashboard build check (when changing src/)
npm ci && npm run build
```

## Boundaries

- Do not `kubectl apply` WorkflowTemplates — ArgoCD owns them.
- Do not SSH into cluster nodes from a workstation; CLI access is via `just`,
  `argo`, and `kubectl`.
- Do not commit transient session artifacts (`TODO-*.md`, `poll-*.log`,
  stale screenshots, etc.) to this repo.
- Cluster-specific hostnames, IPs, and one-off incident notes belong in private
  runbooks, not in this repository.
- Issue tracker for this repo is `projectbluefin/lab`.

## Skill maintenance

At the end of any non-trivial session, update the skill file for the area you
changed if you learned something new. Every session produces two outputs: the
work and the learning.
