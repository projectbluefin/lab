## Pipelines

### bluefin-qa-pipeline
- **Purpose:** Run Bluefin/Bluefin-LTS suites directly inside the published bootc OCI
  image. There is no containerDisk build, VM boot, or SSH stage on this path.
- **Parameters:** `image`, `image-tag`, `suites`, `variant`, `branch`, `pr-number`, `sha`,
  `repo`, `testsuite-branch`, `testsuite-repo`.
- **DAG:** `validate-suites` → parallel `test-lane` items (`smoke`, `common`, `developer`,
  `software`, `system`, filtered by `suites`) using `run-container-tests`.
- **Each lane:** `run-container-tests` clones `projectbluefin/testsuite`, boots a
  Wayland session with `dbus-run-session` + `qecore-headless`, runs `behave`,
  publishes per-suite results back to this repo when `github-token` is present,
  and returns a summary file to the workflow.
- **Image-poll trigger flow:** `image-poller` compares GHCR digests against
  `image-polling-digests`, submits this pipeline on change, and only writes the
  new digest back after the workflow succeeds.
- **Just recipe:** `run-tests`, `run-tests-tag`, `run-tests-matrix`.

### dakota-qa-pipeline
- **Purpose:** Run Dakota suites directly inside the published bootc OCI image using
  the same container-only fan-out model as `bluefin-qa-pipeline`.
- **Parameters:** `image`, `image-tag`, `suites`, `variant`, `branch`, `pr-number`, `sha`,
  `repo`, `testsuite-branch`, `testsuite-repo`.
- **DAG:** `validate-suites` → parallel `test-lane` items (`smoke`, `common`, `developer`,
  `software`, `system`) through `run-container-tests`.
- **Just recipe:** `run-dakota-qa`.

### dakota-build-pipeline
- **Purpose:** The actual BuildStream compile step for Dakota — builds
  `oci/bluefin.bst`, then its dependent `oci/bluefin-nvidia.bst`, and pushes both to
  the local Zot registry. This is what populates/warms the Dakota build cache.
- **Distribution:** `build-mode=re` is mandatory. Cache-only, automatic fallback,
  runner-local execution, and remote-cache-only execution are failures, not
  alternatives. Scheduler-driven placement selects the coordinator; no task
  pins it to a node.
- **Capacity:** The coordinator uses four fetchers, two BuildStream builders and
  pushers, and eight jobs per action. Two BuildBarn workers expose one action
  slot each, so both workers can execute concurrently without oversubscribing a
  runner. The workflow verifies its generated remote-execution configuration
  before it invokes BuildStream.
- **Priority:** `priorityClassName: bst-build` keeps the coordinator ahead of
  short-lived lab test workloads.
- **Who triggers it automatically:** `dakota-commit-poller` (see
  [Cache Warming](#cache-warming-pollers)). The poller resolves the current
  GitHub SHA for `dakota:testing` and passes that exact commit into the local
  BuildStream run, so the lab build checks out the same source revision that
  GitHub is building instead of drifting to a later branch tip.

### cosmic-build-pipeline
- **Purpose:** BuildStream compile pipeline for COSMIC variants
  (`oci/cosmic/image.bst`, `oci/cosmic-nvidia/image.bst`) and push to local Zot.
- **Safety guards (aligned with dakota):**
  `activeDeadlineSeconds: 14400` (workflow), `activeDeadlineSeconds: 5400` (step),
  `retryStrategy: limit=2, retryPolicy=Always`, `GRPC_POLL_STRATEGY=poll`,
  `GRPC_ENABLE_FORK_SUPPORT=1`, `request-timeout: 900`,
  `scheduler.network-retries: 4`, `scheduler.fetchers: 1`.
- **Cache policy:** uses the same shared Buildbarn remote cache/execution path as
  Dakota, via the checked-in `buildstream-remote-cache` config, with
  `override-project-caches: false` and explicit upstream artifact/source cache URLs
  listed as read-only fallbacks while Buildbarn handles artifact writes.

### bluefin-server-build-pipeline
- **Purpose:** BuildStream compile pipeline for Bluefin Server elements
  (`oci/bluefin-server-ddi.bst`, `oci/bluefin-server-installer.bst`) and push to local Zot.
- **Safety guards (aligned with dakota/cosmic):**
  `activeDeadlineSeconds: 14400` (workflow), `activeDeadlineSeconds: 5400` (step),
  `retryStrategy: limit=2, retryPolicy=Always`, `GRPC_POLL_STRATEGY=poll`,
  `GRPC_ENABLE_FORK_SUPPORT=1`, `request-timeout: 900`,
  `scheduler.network-retries: 4`, `scheduler.fetchers: 1`.
- **Cache policy:** uses the shared Buildbarn frontend (`frontend.buildbarn.svc.cluster.local:8980`) for artifact cache writes and remote execution; the current BuildStream image in this cluster does not accept the legacy `remoteasset:` config block, so the config omits it. The checked-in `buildstream-remote-cache` config leaves project cache overrides disabled and lists the project's own upstream artifact/source cache URLs as read-only fallbacks.

### bst-qa-pipeline
- **Purpose:** Smoke-tests the Buildbarn distributed remote-execution grid itself
  by running a trivial BuildStream element through it.
- **Cache + RE wiring:** artifact cache writes, remote execution, and remote asset
  fetches all flow through the shared Buildbarn frontend and remote-asset service
  (`frontend.buildbarn.svc.cluster.local:8980` and
  `bb-remote-asset.buildbarn.svc.cluster.local:8984`). The project cache remotes
  are Buildbarn-only. See [Distributed Build/RE Grid](#distributed-buildre-grid).
- **Known limitation:** the current test element (`hello.bst`, an `import` kind)
  proves config wiring (BuildStream connects to the frontend with no errors) but
  never actually dispatches an action through the scheduler to a worker — verified
  by checking the CAS blocks file (zero bytes written). A real build-dispatch
  test element would be needed to prove end-to-end RE execution conclusively.

### knuckle-qa-pipeline
- **Purpose:** Build the Knuckle installer ISO/binary, provision a blank VM, run
  the headless installer in-cluster, boot the installed system, rediscover SSH
  reachability, and run smoke tests.
- **Parameters:** `branch`, `namespace`, `suite`, `ssh-key-secret`, `tests-branch`.
- **DAG:** `clone-source` → `build-installer` → `provision-target-vm` →
  `boot-installer` → `wait-install-complete` → `transition-to-installed` →
  `discover-installed-ip` → `run-smoke-tests`; `onExit: teardown`
  (`teardown-vm` → `cleanup-installer-artifacts`).
- **Disk:** PVC-backed (`local-path`), not hostDisk/hostPath — KubeVirt
  co-schedules the VM automatically on the PVC's node, no explicit
  `nodeSelector` needed.
- **Just recipe:** None currently; submit the WorkflowTemplate directly or use
  the nightly CronWorkflow.

## Supporting Templates

| Template | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `image-poller` | Digest-comparison trigger for the bootc image-poll lane. Flow: fetch GHCR digest → compare with `image-polling-digests` → submit `bluefin-qa-pipeline` on change → persist digest only after downstream success. |
| `run-container-tests` | Shared container-only runner for Bluefin/Dakota bootc images. Clones `projectbluefin/testsuite`, starts a Wayland session in the target OCI image, runs `behave`, publishes per-suite results back to this repo, and writes a summary file for workflow outputs. |
| `provision-flatcar-vm` / `provision-gnomeos-vm` | VM-backed provisioning paths for the lanes that still need KubeVirt. Both set `priorityClassName: lab-test-vm`. |
| `teardown-vm` | Deletes any KubeVirt test VM (and hostDisk/PVC where applicable). |
| `run-gnome-tests` | Shared VM-backed test runner. Clones `projectbluefin/testsuite`, waits for SSH, installs dependencies, copies `tests/<suite>`, and runs `behave` against a live guest. |
| `run-incluster-tests` | Shared in-cluster pytest runner. Git-syncs `lab`, runs a pytest module against a live k8s workload, emits JUnit XML. |

## Distributed Build/RE Grid

Two independent distributed-build mechanisms exist on the cluster — they solve
different problems and do not overlap:

| Mechanism | What it distributes | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| k8s scheduler (no pin) | Full privileged bootc OCI builds (needs real FUSE/mount-namespace access) | `dakota-build-pipeline`, `bluefin-server-build-pipeline` |
| Buildbarn (`buildbarn` namespace) | BuildStream cache writes and remote-execution actions (chroot-only sandbox, `CAP_SYS_CHROOT`) | `dakota-build-pipeline`, `cosmic-build-pipeline`, `bluefin-server-build-pipeline`, `bst-qa-pipeline` |

Buildbarn topology (2 storage shards, 1 scheduler, 2 frontend replicas, 1
worker+runner DaemonSet pair per node — storage replicas spread with
`podAntiAffinity`) is defined in `manifests/buildbarn-*.yaml`. Dakota requires
the real BuildBarn execution grid. If an action needs unavailable runner
capabilities, the workflow must fail for repair; it must not use a local or
cache-only fallback.

## Cache Warming (Pollers)

| CronWorkflow | Interval | Triggers | Keeps warm |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dakota-commit-poller` | 5 min | `dakota-build-pipeline` when `dakota:testing` gets a new commit digest | the shared Buildbarn cache/execution path for the Dakota BuildStream layer |
| `image-poll-bluefin-{testing,stable}` / `image-poll-lts-{testing,stable}` | 10 min | `image-poller` when the respective GHCR tag digest changes | Bluefin/LTS container-only QA freshness plus result publication |
| `image-poll-snosi-latest` | 30 min past every 3 hours | `bluefin-qa-pipeline` when `ghcr.io/frostyard/snow:latest` changes | Snosi GNOME desktop image coverage |
| `flatcar-kernel-poller` | 10 min | `flatcar-kernel-build` when kernel.org's latest stable version changes | Flatcar kernel build cache |
| `flatcar-kernel-gate` | 30 min | (gate/promotion check, see `docs/skills/flatcar-node-onboarding.md`) | N/A |

Dakota/Cosmic/Bluefin Server/BST lanes now use the shared Buildbarn frontend for
cache writes and remote execution while leaving upstream mirrors read-only. Cold
runs may fetch from upstream source origins, but cache writes stay in-cluster via
Buildbarn.

**`bluefin-server-build-pipeline` has no poller at all** — manual-trigger only,
and deliberately local-cache-only (commit `22c7d2ad`, "use local-cache path... for
extreme stability"). It is cold by design on every run; this is an intentional
trade-off, not a gap.

**`nightly-dakota` does not warm anything** — it's wired to `dakota-qa-pipeline`
(test runner against pre-built images), not `dakota-build-pipeline` (the actual
compile step). The real dakota cache-warming trigger is `dakota-commit-poller`.

All bluefin/lts image pollers plus `dakota-commit-poller`/
`flatcar-kernel-poller`/`flatcar-kernel-gate` were briefly suspended (2026-06-28
through 2026-07-02) while a real bug was fixed in the poller arguments. Fixed
in commit `be045b12` with a regression test (`tests/unit/test_workflow_defaults.py`),
then re-enabled after confirming the digest-comparison path and downstream
container-only QA held under repeated runs.

**Current contract:** `image-poller` must not update `image-polling-digests`
until `run-pipeline.Succeeded`. If the digest is written before QA passes, the
poller will treat the image as already seen and silently skip the failed lane on
the next cycle.

## Nightly Schedule

| CronWorkflow | Time (UTC) | Pipeline | Parameters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `nightly-smoke` | 02:00 | `bluefin-qa-pipeline` | `image=ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin`, `image-tag=testing`, `suites=smoke,developer,system`, `variant=bluefin` |
| `nightly-smoke-lts` | 02:30 | `bluefin-qa-pipeline` | `image=ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin-lts`, `image-tag=testing`, `suites=smoke,developer,system`, `variant=bluefin-lts` |
| `nightly-dakota` | — | `dakota-qa-pipeline` | Tests pre-built images only — does not build/warm cache. Currently `suspend: true`. |
| `nightly-knuckle` | 03:30 | `knuckle-qa-pipeline` | `branch=main`, `namespace=knuckle-test`, `suite=smoke`, `tests-branch=main` |

## Priority Classes

| PriorityClass | Value | Applied to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lab-test-vm` | 1,000,000, `PreemptLowerPriority` | All explicit VM-backed KubeVirt test VMs (`provision-flatcar-vm`, `provision-gnomeos-vm`, and `knuckle-qa-pipeline`'s VM specs) |
| `bst-build` | (see `manifests/bst-build-priorityclass.yaml`) | Heavy/long BuildStream compiles: `dakota-build-pipeline`, `bluefin-server-build-pipeline`, `flatcar-kernel-build`'s VM spec |

Test VMs are meant to win resource contention over background build workloads —
`lab-test-vm`'s higher priority value plus `PreemptLowerPriority` enforces this
against any pod using `bst-build`.
