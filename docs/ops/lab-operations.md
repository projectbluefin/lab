# Lab Operations Guide

> **Routine work? Load [`/docs/reference/agent-cheatsheet.md`](/docs/reference/agent-cheatsheet.md) first.** This guide is the expanded operations manual: more context, longer procedures, and explicit decision trees.

Pair with:
- [`/docs/reference/agent-cheatsheet.md`](/docs/reference/agent-cheatsheet.md) — canonical command reference
- [`../AGENTS.md`](/agents.md) — policy + architecture
- [`../RUNBOOK.md`](/docs/ops/RUNBOOK.md) — timeless architecture + failure modes
- [`../WORKFLOWS.md`](/docs/reference/WORKFLOWS.md) — WorkflowTemplate parameter contracts
- [`/docs/skills/test-authoring/dogtail-patterns.md`](/docs/skills/test-authoring/dogtail-patterns.md) — GUI test authoring


> [!WARNING]
> **Use the CLI-first hierarchy for cluster operations:** `just` for routine
> lifecycle actions, then `argo` or `kubectl` for direct inspection and control.
> MCP is optional and must not block an operation. The only acceptable SSH path
> in this repo is **in-cluster** access from workflow/probe pods into test VMs
> when the test harness or post-mortem artifact collection requires it.
>
> **Exception:** SSH to ghost is permitted exclusively to start or stop the `k3s` service — you cannot stop the API server via the API itself. See [§ Turning k8s on/off](#turning-k8s-onoff).

## 1. The 60-second mental model

```text
image-poller CronWorkflow
  └─ digest comparison against image-polling-digests ConfigMap
       ├─ unchanged ─► exit cleanly
       └─ changed   ─► run-container-tests fan-out
                         ├─ publish per-suite results back to the repo
                         └─ update digest state only after QA succeeds
```

For Bluefin and Dakota image-poll QA, **bootc OCI images are tested directly as containers**. Boot, disk, and install validation are retired from the image-poll path; keep KubeVirt workflows only for lanes that explicitly still need them (Flatcar, Knuckle, migration, and similar).

---

## 2. Picking the right path

| Goal | Preferred path |
|---|---|
| Validate a smoke test or step change | `just run-tests-tag testing` |
| Validate atomic OS contract checks | Use Argo MCP to submit `bluefin-qa-pipeline` with `suites=system` |
| Validate developer or software suites | Use Argo MCP to submit `bluefin-qa-pipeline` with `suites=developer` or `suites=software` |
| Validate a bootc OCI image change | `just run-tests-tag <testing\|lts-testing\|stable\|lts-stable>` or `just run-tests-matrix` |
| Pre-merge gate / promote a passing matrix run | `just run-tests-matrix` |
| Validate Flatcar | `just run-flatcar-smoke` |
| Submit Dakota distributed BST build pipeline (bluefin + nvidia) | `just run-bst-build [ref=testing]` |

Rule: if a `just` recipe exists, use it. Otherwise use `argo` or `kubectl`;
MCP is optional.

Every BST run requires `build-mode=re`, fresh USB4 `up` observations on both
`ghost` and `exo-0`, two Ready BuildBarn workers, and observable worker actions.
If any precondition or remote execution is unhealthy, fail, diagnose, and
repair it. Do not select local, cache-only, Ethernet-backed, or automatic
fallback.

## 3. Repo-owner wrappers vs. agent paths

The `Justfile` intentionally keeps local `kubectl` / `argo` convenience wrappers for the repo owner.
Those wrappers are acceptable for Jorge on the workstation, but they are **not** the agent/autonomous path.

For agents and automated systems:
- Workflow reads / logs / control → Argo MCP
- Pod, VM, Secret, and node reads / mutations → Kubernetes MCP
- GitOps changes → edit tracked YAML, push to git, let ArgoCD reconcile
- No SSH to ghost, exo-1, or any node — except `sudo systemctl start|stop k3s` on ghost (see below)

---

## 4. Retrieving evidence

### 4.1 Workflow status and logs

Use MCP first:
- `argo-mcp-list_workflows`
- `argo-mcp-get_workflow`
- `argo-mcp-logs_workflow`
- `argo-mcp-list_workflow_templates`

Repo-owner wrapper when needed:
- `just logs`
- `just list-workflows`

### 4.2 Runner artifacts

The runner echoes `results.json`, `pytest-results.xml`, and `atspi_tree.txt` into pod stderr before exit.
Use `argo logs` or the Argo UI instead of shelling into pods.

### 4.4 Updating files without workstation `scp`

If you need to push helper files or test content into the cluster, do **not** `scp` them to ghost or exo-1 from a workstation. Use a ConfigMap plus a short-lived Job created through Kubernetes MCP (`kubernetes-mcp-resources_create_or_update`):

1. Create or update a ConfigMap containing the files.
2. Create a scheduler-admitted Job that mounts the ConfigMap and writes only to
   its PVC-backed workload volume.
3. Wait for the Job to complete, then clean it up if it was ad hoc.

This keeps file staging API-driven and works even when node SSH is unavailable.

---

## 5. Failure triage

Start with the exact workflow that failed.

### 5.1 `No GITHUB_TOKEN or missing results.json - skipping publication`

1. `kubectl get secret -n argo github-token`
   - **Expected:** secret exists.
   - **If missing:** restore the secret and rerun the workflow.
2. `just logs | grep -n "skipping publication\|results.json"`
   - **Expected:** the failing `run-container-tests` lane is visible in the log.
3. If `results.json` is missing, fix the failing suite or image dependency before rerunning.

### 5.2 `results.json not found` or summary reports `Execution failed`

1. `just logs | grep -n "results.json not found\|Execution failed"`
   - **Expected:** the failing suite appears before the summary line.
2. `argo-mcp-logs_workflow <workflow-name>`
   - **Expected:** enough detail to identify the broken container lane, suite, or dependency install.
3. Rerun the relevant container-only workflow after fixing the image or testsuite issue.

### 5.3 `TypeError` mentioning `requireResult`

1. `just logs | grep -n "requireResult"`
   - **Expected:** a traceback line identifying the failing step file.
2. Replace `findChild(..., requireResult=...)` with `findChildren(...)` or `findChild(..., retry=False)`.
3. Rerun the relevant workflow after fixing the stale test code.

### 5.4 All top-bar scenarios fail together

1. `just logs | grep -n "wait_for_shell.py"`
   - **Expected:** the runner copied and invoked `wait_for_shell.py`.
2. `just logs | grep -n "unsafe_mode"`
   - **Expected:** the session enabled `global.context.unsafe_mode = true`.
3. If either check is missing:
   - **Next:** fix the runner/template in git, push, and submit a new workflow.

### 5.5 `Application "gnome-shell" is running` fails

1. `just logs | grep -n 'Application "gnome-shell" is running'`
   - **Expected:** the failing step appears in the log.
2. Replace that scenario step with `* GNOME Shell is accessible via AT-SPI`.
3. Rerun the affected workflow.

### 5.6 Workflow stuck `Pending`

1. `just list-workflows`
2. `kubernetes-mcp-nodes_top`
3. `kubernetes-mcp-pods_list fieldSelector=status.phase=Pending`
4. `kubernetes-mcp-pods_top all_namespaces=true`
5. If orphaned `virt-launcher-*` capacity is the problem:
   - **Next:** use Kubernetes MCP to create a one-shot Job cloned from `orphan-vm-cleanup`.

### 5.7 `outputs.result` contains debug text

1. `just logs | grep -n 'outputs.result'`
   - **Expected:** the polluted result string appears in the workflow log.
2. Edit the offending `script:` template so debug goes to `>&2`.
3. Run `just lint`, push, and verify ArgoCD reconciliation.

### 5.8 VM stuck `Terminating`

1. Use `kubernetes-mcp-pods_list_in_namespace` to find the matching `virt-launcher-*` pod.
2. Delete that pod with `kubernetes-mcp-pods_delete`.
3. Re-check the VM with `kubernetes-mcp-resources_get`.

### 5.9 `run-gnome-tests` pod errors immediately

1. `argo-mcp-get_workflow <workflow-name>`
   - **Expected:** the failing template or pod name is visible.
2. `argo-mcp-logs_workflow <workflow-name>`
   - **Expected:** enough detail to identify the bad template field.
3. If `volumes:` is nested under `container:`:
   - **Next:** move it to template scope in git, push, and run `just lint`.

### 5.10 Unknown failure class

1. `just logs`
2. `argo logs -n argo <workflow-name>`
3. `argo-mcp-get_workflow <workflow-name>`

Expected outcome: after step 4 or 5 you should have a concrete failing template, step, or VM phase to route back into one of the branches above.

---

## 6. ArgoCD operations

### 6.1 What ArgoCD owns

| Application | Syncs |
|---|---|
| `lab` | `argo/workflow-templates/*.yaml` |
| `lab-infra` | `manifests/*.yaml` |

### 6.2 Decision tree — my template change did not take effect

1. `git log -1 origin/main -- argo/workflow-templates/<file>`
   - **Expected:** the output includes your commit.
2. `just argocd-status`
   - **Expected:** `lab` is synced to a revision that matches or post-dates your commit.
   - **If older:** `just argocd-sync`.
3. `just argocd-status`
   - **Expected:** `lab` is Healthy.
4. `argo-mcp-get_workflow_template <name>`
   - **Expected:** the new value is live.
5. Submit a **new** workflow.
   - **Expected:** the new run sees the new template snapshot.

Do **not** `kubectl apply` a rejected WorkflowTemplate.

---

## 7. Load triage

Use these in order:
1. `just list-workflows`
2. `kubernetes-mcp-nodes_top`
3. `kubernetes-mcp-resources_list apiVersion=kubevirt.io/v1 kind=VirtualMachineInstance`
4. `kubernetes-mcp-pods_list fieldSelector=status.phase=Pending`
5. `kubernetes-mcp-pods_top all_namespaces=true`

Answer three questions in order:
1. Are `run-container-tests` or `image-poller` pods saturating ghost CPU or memory?
2. Are `virt-launcher-*` pods from VM-backed lanes consuming capacity with no corresponding live workflow?
3. Are runner pods pending because CPU or memory is exhausted?

---

## 8. SSH key rotation

The key rotation flow is still valid because it manages the **in-cluster** test-access secret, not workstation SSH.
Use the exact command block in [`/docs/reference/agent-cheatsheet.md`](/docs/reference/agent-cheatsheet.md) §6.

After rotation:
1. Update `manifests/bluefin-test-ssh-pubkey.yaml` with the new base64-encoded public key and push to main.
2. Run a VM-backed validation lane such as `just run-migration-test testing` and `just run-flatcar-smoke`.
3. If fresh workflows still fail SSH, verify the `bluefin-test-ssh-pubkey` secret was updated and ArgoCD synced it.

---

## 9. PR queue mode

1. Run the minimum required lab loop (`just run-tests-tag testing`; use `just run-tests-matrix` for high-risk work).
2. Collect workflow names, behave summaries, and log excerpts via MCP.
3. Keep PR comments minimal: report what ran, pass/fail, and blockers only. Do not duplicate GitHub UI state.
4. Only then label / approve / queue.

---

## 10. Turning k8s on/off

The **only** legitimate reason to SSH from a workstation to the control plane is to start or stop the `k3s` service. The API server cannot shut itself down — SSH is required.

```bash
# Stop all of Kubernetes (API, etcd, all pods go down)
ssh core@<control-plane-ip> "sudo systemctl stop k3s"

# Start it back up
ssh core@<control-plane-ip> "sudo systemctl start k3s"

# Verify
ssh core@<control-plane-ip> "sudo systemctl is-active k3s"
```

Everything else — pod management, workflow control, ConfigMaps, scaling — goes through MCP. No other workstation SSH to ghost is permitted.
