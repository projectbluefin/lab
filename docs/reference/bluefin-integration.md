# Bluefin Integration

This homelab instance is the CI backend for Project Bluefin. Selected image-poll
lanes trigger container-only acceptance runs when their registry digest changes;
structured per-suite results are published back into this repo for dashboard and
release consumers.

## Images Under Test

| Image | Tag | Trigger | QA path |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin` | `testing` | Nightly 02:00 UTC; digest freshness poll every 10 minutes at :00 (QA disabled) | Nightly `bluefin-qa-pipeline` → `run-container-tests` |
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin` | `stable` | Nightly 03:00 UTC; digest poll every 10 minutes at :04 | `image-poller` → `bluefin-qa-pipeline` → `run-container-tests` (full suite) |
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin-lts` | `testing` | Nightly 02:30 UTC; digest freshness poll every 10 minutes at :02 (QA disabled) | Nightly `bluefin-qa-pipeline` → `run-container-tests` |
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin-lts` | `stable` | Nightly 03:30 UTC; digest poll every 10 minutes at :06 | `image-poller` → `bluefin-qa-pipeline` → `run-container-tests` (full suite) |
| `ghcr.io/frostyard/snow` | `latest` | Every 3 hours at :30 + digest change | `image-poller` → `bluefin-qa-pipeline` → `run-container-tests` (`smoke,developer,system`) |
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/dakota` | `testing` | Nightly 03:00 UTC; digest freshness poll every 10 minutes at :08 (QA disabled) | Nightly `dakota-qa-pipeline` → `run-container-tests` |

Bluefin and Bluefin-LTS `:testing` lanes use the daily schedules above; their
digest pollers retain freshness state without launching QA. Stable lanes retain
their existing schedules. Dakota follows the same daily-only testing-lane
policy. Never use date tags in automation.

## Test Suites

All Bluefin image test scenarios live in **[`projectbluefin/testsuite`](https://github.com/projectbluefin/testsuite)** — the single source of truth. The lab's `run-container-tests` WorkflowTemplate clones `testsuite` (main or a branch) and runs qecore-headless + behave directly inside the published bootc OCI image. VM-backed KubeVirt coverage remains for the workflows that explicitly still need it, but the image-poll path no longer boots or installs a guest.

For the desktop epic's ownership boundary and actionable GNOME coverage
slices, see [`desktop-coverage.md`](desktop-coverage.md). Do not add Bluefin
desktop scenarios to this repository.

Each pipeline run executes one or more suites via the `suites` parameter (comma-separated).

### smoke
GNOME Shell acceptance tests. Validates the desktop is functional after boot.

- Activities button opens and closes the overview
- `dash-to-dock` is present and responds to AT-SPI
- `blur-my-shell` and app-indicator extensions are loaded (Bluefin-specific)
- Top-bar clock and quick-settings accessible via Shell.Eval JS (GNOME Shell 50)
- Screenshot captured at end of each scenario

### developer
Bluefin developer tooling validation. Validates the tools Bluefin ships for developers.

- Homebrew: `brew` in PATH, `brew install` resolves packages
- Podman: `podman run hello-world` succeeds
- Distrobox: `distrobox list` runs without error
- Dev mode (`ujust enable-dev-mode`): systemd service activated, no fatal journal entries
- Ptyxis terminal opens and accepts input

### common
Atomic OS contract and system health tests. Validates Bluefin's immutable-image guarantees.

- `bootc status` reports a known good deployment
- `/usr` is mounted read-only
- XDG portal health + integration
- Flatpak model and state
- polkit rules, shell environment, ujust recipes
- GSettings/dconf defaults, desktop entries, signing assertions

### flatcar (separate pipeline)
Flatcar OS substrate tests. Not part of the Bluefin image pipelines; runs via
`flatcar-smoke-test.yaml`.

## Image-Poll Trigger

The Bluefin and Bluefin-LTS image-poll CronWorkflows run every 10 minutes at
staggered offsets (`:00`, `:02`, `:04`, and `:06`) and call the generic
`image-poller` WorkflowTemplate. Dakota's `image-poll-dakota` CronWorkflow runs
at `:08` with `run-qa=false`: it tracks the Dakota testing digest for freshness
only, and daily QA comes from `nightly-dakota` at 03:00 UTC. Each poll run:

1. Resolves the current digest for the target image by inspecting the upstream
   registry directly (never through the zot cache — a tag read triggers zot
   on-demand sync of the full image; see PR #632)
2. Reads the last-known digest from `image-polling-digests` in namespace `argo`
3. If digests match: exits cleanly (no test run)
4. If the digest changed: submits `bluefin-qa-pipeline` for Bluefin/LTS
   (Dakota tracks only); each fans out `run-container-tests`
5. Each selected suite attempts to publish its structured results back into this repo
6. The generic Bluefin/LTS `image-poller` persists its new digest only after the
   downstream workflow succeeds

This means a changed Bluefin or Bluefin-LTS digest triggers
container-only validation within 10 minutes, automatically, with no human action.

## Result Publication Pipeline

`run-container-tests` writes `results.json` and, when `github-token` is
available, clones this repository and attempts `scripts/publish_test_results.py`
to merge the new suite outcome into the tracked results data. Publication is
best-effort: a publication warning does not change the suite exit status. The
publication flow is:

1. Execute the selected behave suite inside the bootc OCI image
2. Write `results.json`, `behave-rc.txt`, and a summary file under `/tmp/results`
3. Clone `projectbluefin/lab` with `github-token`
4. Run `scripts/publish_test_results.py` for the image/suite/workflow tuple
5. Attempt to push the updated structured results back to the repo for dashboard
   consumers

The result: a selected Bluefin or Dakota image is tested in containers, and the
repo receives per-suite QA results when publication succeeds, without any
VM-specific artifact handling.

## Triggering a Test Run Manually

```bash
# Smoke suite against bluefin:testing
just run-tests

# Smoke suite against bluefin-lts:testing
just run-tests-tag lts-testing

# Run the default testing/lts-testing matrix
just run-tests-matrix

# Submit the container-only workflow directly
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/bluefin-qa-pipeline \
  -p image-tag=testing -p suites=smoke -n argo --watch
```

The `just` wrappers are thin shims around `argo submit`. See `Justfile` for the
full parameter set.

## PR Feedback Poller (`pr-label-poller`)

The `pr-label-poller` CronWorkflow runs every 5 minutes and dispatches QA in two
passes:

- **Pass 1 — auto-test repos.** Every open PR in the poller's `AUTO_REPOS` list
  (`projectbluefin/common`, `knuckle`) is tested with no label required.
- **Pass 2 — label catch-all.** Any open `projectbluefin` PR labeled
  `test-on-lab` is also picked up.
- **Retired repos.** Repos in `RETIRED_REPOS` are skipped by both passes and
  never receive a dispatch or a status. `projectbluefin/testsuite` is retired:
  its lab gate is not in service and was never one of its required status
  checks.

For each PR it has not already processed (idempotency is tracked by looking for
an existing Argo workflow for that repo + head SHA), it:

1. Identifies the target repo and routes to the matching WorkflowTemplate.
2. Creates the Argo workflow with the PR's branch/SHA as parameters.
3. Sends a `repository_dispatch` (`event_type: "lab-check"`) to the target repo,
   which its `.github/workflows/lab-check.yml` turns into a `testing-lab / <repo>`
   Check Run (queued → in-progress → completed). No commit status or PR comment
   is created.

Feedback only surfaces when the target repo ships the `lab-check.yml` receiver;
see the two-sided enrollment contract in
[`WORKFLOWS.md`](./WORKFLOWS.md) "Factory PR feedback".

To force a run outside `AUTO_REPOS`: add the `test-on-lab` label to a PR in the
`projectbluefin` org. The poller picks it up within 5 minutes. This does not
override `RETIRED_REPOS`.

## Dakota

Dakota runs through `dakota-qa-pipeline` rather than `bluefin-qa-pipeline`, but
the QA lane uses the same container-only fan-out through `run-container-tests`.
BuildStream artifact builds remain separate in `dakota-build-pipeline`; the
`image-poll-dakota` lane tracks the resulting `:testing` digest (`run-qa=false`)
and `nightly-dakota` at 03:00 UTC runs the daily QA. Dakota PRs can also
use the `test-on-lab` label via the PR label poller.
