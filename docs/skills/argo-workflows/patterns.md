# Argo Workflows Common Patterns

### 14. Decoupling slow build steps from test pipelines (image-sync pattern)

Any pipeline step that conditionally runs a slow build (compilation, disk conversion)
belongs in a **separate CronWorkflow**, not inline in the test pipeline. The test pipeline
asserts the artifact exists and fails fast — it never triggers a rebuild.

**Two-component design:**

```
[digest-watch CronWorkflow, every 5 min]
  step 1 (skopeo): GET current GHCR image digest (authenticated via github-token secret)
  step 2 (curl → k8s API): GET stored digest from ConfigMap containerdisk-source-digests
  match?    → exit 0 (skip)
  mismatch? → PATCH ConfigMap with new digest (claim it, create if 404)
              POST Workflow JSON to k8s API (async build)

[test pipeline (bluefin-qa-pipeline)]
  assert-cd: skopeo inspect Zot → tag exists? → proceed
                                → missing?  → exit 1 "containerdisk not ready"
```

**Rules:**
- Digest watch uses `quay.io/skopeo/stable@sha256:c7d3c512612f52805023cd38351081dad7e2729fc13d14b701e47c7c8bdd6615` (has skopeo + curl, no kubectl needed):
  ```bash
  # Authenticated digest fetch — works for all GHCR images (public + org-restricted)
  LIVE_DIGEST=$(skopeo inspect \
    --no-tags \
    --format '{{.Digest}}' \
    --creds "_token:${GITHUB_TOKEN}" \
    "docker://${IMAGE}:${IMAGE_TAG}" 2>/dev/null)
  ```
  Anonymous GHCR token API returns a 60-char non-JWT token that produces 404 on manifest
  requests — do NOT use the anonymous token endpoint. Use PAT via `--creds "_token:PAT"`.
- `quay.io/skopeo/stable@sha256:c7d3c512612f52805023cd38351081dad7e2729fc13d14b701e47c7c8bdd6615` does **not** include `python3` or `jq`. Keep digest comparison
  shell-only (`tr`/`sed`) or install tooling explicitly; otherwise stored digest reads collapse to
  empty and every poll cycle submits duplicate `build-cd-sync-*` workflows.
- Use in-cluster k8s API (SA token at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/`)
  with `curl` for all ConfigMap and Workflow CRUD — no kubectl image needed.
- **HTTP status detection trap**: `curl -sf -w "%{http_code}" ... || echo "000"` appends
  "000" to curl's stdout output when curl fails. Use a tmpfile instead:
  ```bash
  HTTP_CODE_FILE=$(mktemp)
  curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -o /dev/null ... > "${HTTP_CODE_FILE}" || true
  HTTP=$(cat "${HTTP_CODE_FILE}"); rm -f "${HTTP_CODE_FILE}"
  ```
- The ConfigMap (`containerdisk-source-digests`) stores **GHCR source digests**, not Zot
  containerdisk digests — the two images are different (source bootc OCI vs qcow2 OCI containerDisk)
- ConfigMap is patched by the workflow, NOT managed by ArgoCD. Do not put it in `manifests/`.
  Create it in the first workflow run via POST if PATCH returns 404.
- Submitting a build via k8s API (no extra image dependency):
  ```bash
  curl -sf --cacert "${CACERT}" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${SA_TOKEN}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST \
    "${KS}/apis/argoproj.io/v1alpha1/namespaces/argo/workflows" \
    -d '{"apiVersion":"argoproj.io/v1alpha1","kind":"Workflow","metadata":{"generateName":"build-cd-sync-testing-","namespace":"argo"},"spec":{"workflowTemplateRef":{"name":"build-containerdisk"},"arguments":{"parameters":[{"name":"image","value":"..."}]}}}'
  ```
- `assert-cd` in the test pipeline uses the existing `build-containerdisk/check` template
  but must **exit 1 on missing**, not just output `"missing"` (the original `check` template
  is non-failing — write a new `assert` template that calls skopeo and fails on empty result)

**Why ConfigMap over Zot annotation:**
- Zot annotations require `oras` tooling to set post-push; ConfigMap needs only `curl`
- The ConfigMap stores the *source* digest, not the containerdisk digest — conceptually different

### 15. VM concurrency — k8s native scheduling (no semaphores)

VM concurrency is managed by the **k8s scheduler via virt-launcher pod memory requests**, not Argo semaphores. When a node has insufficient RAM, the virt-launcher pod stays Pending. When a VM finishes, resources free up and the scheduler picks the next Pending pod. FIFO ordering follows workflow creation timestamp.

**Do not add `spec.synchronization.semaphores` to VM pipeline specs.** The semaphore approach was removed because:
- Slots were held at workflow scope, not VM-live scope — a 3h pipeline held a slot during build/assert/teardown, not just while the VM was running
- Build workflows (no VM) held VM slots, starving actual test workflows
- The slot count was a manually-maintained number that drifted from actual hardware

**What to do instead:** ensure VM specs have explicit memory requests so the scheduler has accurate data:
```yaml
domain:
  memory:
    guest: "{{inputs.parameters.vm-memory}}"   # KubeVirt sets virt-launcher request from this
```

**All pipelines still need `activeDeadlineSeconds`** so stuck VMs self-evict:
```yaml
activeDeadlineSeconds: 3600   # 1h for containerdisk, 7200 for knuckle
```

**VMs float to any KubeVirt-capable node** — no `nodeSelector: kubernetes.io/hostname: ghost` in VM specs. The registry-mirror-config DaemonSet writes the Zot HTTP registry config to all nodes.

### 16. GitHub Contents API or Standalone Git Push-back — Prefer Standalone Python for Complex Files

When a workflow pod needs to push a simple file to a GitHub repo, use `curl` + `jq` inside the bash script (Contents API).

However, for complex updates (such as parsing BDD/behave test results, merging with historical runs, and capping the history), **never use inline python or complex inline bash blocks**. Instead, extract the logic into a **standalone Python script** inside the repository (e.g. `scripts/publish_test_results.py`), clone the repository dynamically within the container using `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and run the script locally to perform a standard git transaction (`git clone` → update → `git commit` → `git push`).

**Pattern for Standalone Git Push-back:**
```yaml
        if [[ -n "${GITHUB_TOKEN:-}" ]]; then
          echo "Publishing test results back to lab repository..." >&2
          rm -rf /tmp/lab-code
          git clone --depth 1 "https://x-access-token:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/projectbluefin/lab.git" /tmp/lab-code
          python3 /tmp/lab-code/scripts/publish_test_results.py /tmp/results/results.json "${IMG_SLUG}" "${SUITE}" "{{workflow.name}}" "${GITHUB_TOKEN}" || echo "Warning: failed to publish test results" >&2
        else
          echo "No GITHUB_TOKEN - skipping test results publication" >&2
        fi
```

**Contents API Pattern (for simple single-file writes, verified against Context7 `/websites/github_en_rest`):**
```bash
# GET current file sha (required for updates)
CURRENT=$(curl -sf \
  -H "Authorization: token ${GITHUB_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/contents/PATH/file.json" || echo "{}")
FILE_SHA=$(echo "$CURRENT" | jq -r '.sha // empty')

# Build payload with jq — no Python, no heredocs
CONTENT=$(echo "$PAYLOAD_OBJ" | base64 -w0)
BODY=$(jq -nc \
  --arg msg "commit message" \
  --arg content "$CONTENT" \
  --arg sha "$FILE_SHA" \
  'if $sha != "" then {message:$msg,content:$content,sha:$sha} else {message:$msg,content:$content} end')

# PUT — sha required for updates, omit for new files
HTTP_CODE=$(curl -sf -w "%{http_code}" -o /tmp/response.json \
  -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: token ${GITHUB_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$BODY" "https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/contents/PATH/file.json")
```

Key rules:
- `sha` field required when updating an existing file; omit for new files (404 on GET = new file)
- `content` must be base64 encoded; use `base64 -w0` (no line wraps)
- `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28` header required by current GitHub API
- Retain output through Argo logs/artifacts or a workflow PVC — never a
  root-backed hostPath
- Concurrent pipeline exits conflict on SHA → last writer wins; 409 = silent skip. Acceptable for metrics files.

#### Container-only QA runner: publish digest-pinned results

`run-container-tests` runs inside a privileged `quay.io/podman/stable:latest` container, which does not include `git` or `skopeo`. When publishing BDD evidence back to the lab repo:

1. Install tooling if it is missing: `command -v skopeo >/dev/null || dnf install -y skopeo` and `command -v git >/dev/null || dnf install -y git-core`.
2. Resolve the digest of `{{inputs.parameters.image}}:{{inputs.parameters.image-tag}}` with `skopeo inspect --no-tags --format '{{.Digest}}' "docker://${IMAGE}"`. Treat a missing digest as a non-fatal warning.
3. Compute the image slug as `IMG_SLUG="${VARIANT}-${IMAGE_TAG}"` so the result file name matches the contract used by `run-gnome-tests` (e.g. `bluefin-stable-smoke.json`).
4. Perform the git push-back in a best-effort block: log a warning if `git clone` or `publish_test_results.py` fails, but do not let a publication error fail the test workflow.
5. Pass the resolved digest as the optional sixth positional argument to `publish_test_results.py` so the collector can match QA evidence to the currently published image digest.


**Why no inline Python or heredocs (root cause):** YAML `source: |` literal blocks use indentation to determine block extent. Any line at column 0 (including unindented `python3 -c "...\nimport json\n..."` continuation lines, or heredoc bodies like `<<'EOF'\nimport json\n`) terminates the block — YAML treats those lines as new top-level keys. The `yaml: could not find expected ':'` error is the symptom. Fix: use `jq` one-liners, keep everything on the same indented line, or `--rawfile` to read from a pre-staged file.

**onExit dashboard update pattern (bluefin-qa-pipeline + dakota-qa-pipeline):**
```yaml
- name: update-factory-stats
  script:
    image: quay.io/fedora/fedora:latest
    command: [bash]
    env:
      - name: GITHUB_TOKEN
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: github-token
            key: token
    source: |
      set -euo pipefail
      API_URL="https://api.github.com/repos/projectbluefin/lab/contents/docs/data/factory-stats.json"
      # Fetch JSON file + SHA
      CURRENT=$(curl -sf -H "Authorization: token ${GITHUB_TOKEN}" \
        -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" "${API_URL}" || echo "{}")
      FILE_SHA=$(echo "$CURRENT" | jq -r '.sha // empty')
      [[ -z "$FILE_SHA" ]] && echo "No SHA — skipping" && exit 0
      STATS=$(echo "$CURRENT" | jq -r '.content // ""' | tr -d '\n' | base64 -d \
        | jq '.')
      # Build run entry with jq — no Python, no heredocs
      NEW_RUN=$(jq -nc --arg id "{{workflow.name}}" --arg overall "pass_or_fail" \
        '{id:$id,overall:$overall,...}')
      UPDATED=$(echo "$STATS" | jq -c --argjson run "$NEW_RUN" --arg now "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
        '.recent_runs = ([$run] + (.recent_runs // []) | .[:15]) | ._meta.generated = $now')
      BODY=$(jq -nc --arg msg "chore: update dashboard run data" \
        --arg content "$(echo "$UPDATED" | base64 -w0)" --arg sha "$FILE_SHA" \
        '{message:$msg,content:$content,sha:$sha}')
      curl -sf -w "%{http_code}" -o /dev/null -X PUT \
        -H "Authorization: token ${GITHUB_TOKEN}" \
        -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d "$BODY" "${API_URL}"
```
The real implementation in `bluefin-qa-pipeline.yaml` also fetches per-suite result files into `/tmp/suite-scores/` and merges them via `jq --argjson` one-liners before building `NEW_RUN`.

### 17. CronWorkflow — `schedules` not `schedule`

CronWorkflow uses `schedules` (plural array), not `schedule` (singular string). The singular field does not exist in the CRD schema — ArgoCD's ServerSideApply validation will reject it.

```yaml
# ✗ WRONG — rejected by ArgoCD schema validation
spec:
  schedule: "0 * * * *"

# ✅ CORRECT
spec:
  schedules:
    - "0 * * * *"
```

Verified against Context7 `/argoproj/argo-workflows` CronWorkflow spec docs.

CronWorkflows also cannot be invoked via `workflowTemplateRef` — if you need a CronWorkflow to be submittable manually, extract its logic into a WorkflowTemplate and have the CronWorkflow reference it with `workflowTemplateRef`.

### 18. `when` condition trap — never reference a Skipped task's outputs

**Verified against Context7 `/argoproj/argo-workflows` enhanced-depends-logic docs:**
> "If a downstream task references outputs from a task that was Skipped or Omitted,
> those references will resolve to empty strings."

So `'{{tasks.check.outputs.result}}' != 'exists'` becomes `'' != 'exists'` = `true` when
the upstream is Skipped. In theory the build should run. In practice (Argo v4.0.5), we
observed the downstream task never being scheduled at all — the controller logs show
`"was unable to obtain the node"` for it and the workflow stalls with only 2 nodes.

The safe, version-independent fix: **never put a `when` guard on the task that owns the
gate output. Move the bypass inside the script.**

**Example of the fragile pattern:**
```yaml
- name: check
  when: "'{{inputs.parameters.force}}' != 'true'"   # Skipped when force=true
  template: check

- name: build
  depends: "(check.Succeeded || check.Skipped)"
  when: "'{{tasks.check.outputs.result}}' != 'exists'"  # resolves to '' when Skipped → unpredictable
  template: build
```

**The robust fix:**
```yaml
- name: check           # always runs — no 'when' on this task
  template: check       # script handles force=true internally

- name: build
  depends: "check.Succeeded"
  when: "'{{tasks.check.outputs.result}}' != 'exists'"   # ✅ always defined
  template: build
```

Inside the `check` script:
```bash
if [[ "{{inputs.parameters.force}}" == "true" ]]; then
  echo "missing"   # short-circuit — always rebuild
  exit 0
fi
# … real existence check …
```

**Rule:** If a task has a `when` guard AND downstream tasks reference its outputs,
remove the `when` guard and move the bypass into the script body.

**Symptoms of this bug:**
- Workflow shows phase `Running` but only 1–2 nodes (the DAG + the Skipped task)
- No `install-to-disk` or equivalent node ever created
- Controller logs show `"was unable to obtain the node"` for the downstream task (normal reconciliation noise)
- `force=true` workflows submitted after a digest change never actually build

### 19. `when` condition values with hyphens must be quoted or avoided

Argo's `when` expression parser (expr-lang based) treats an unquoted hyphenated
string as a subtraction expression. A condition like:

```yaml
when: "{{inputs.parameters.mode}} == cache-only"
```

expands to `cache-only == cache-only`, which fails with:

```
Value 'cache' cannot be used with the modifier '-', it is not a number
```

**Fixes:**

1. Quote the literal: `when: "{{inputs.parameters.mode}} == 'cache-only'"` works
   for values that expr-lang can parse as a single quoted string.
2. Safer: avoid hyphens in the enumerated value entirely. Use `local` instead of
   `cache-only` and quote the comparison: `when: "{{inputs.parameters.mode}} == 'local'"`.

Always lint after changing `when` expressions, then submit a test workflow to
verify the DAG branches are scheduled as expected before relying on the path in
production.

### 20. Mutex contention from stuck failed builds

The `ghost-heavy-compute` mutex (on the `install-to-disk` template) allows only one
concurrent build at a time. Failed workflows that were stopped via `shutdown: Stop` **release
the mutex**, but workflows that exit with a non-zero script error may hold the mutex until
the workflow GC TTL clears them.

**Check what holds the mutex:**
```bash
kubectl logs -n argo -l app=workflow-controller --since=2m 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -i "ghost-heavy\|mutex\|Could not acquire"
```

**Stop a workflow holding the mutex:**
```bash
kubectl patch workflow <name> -n argo -p '{"spec":{"shutdown":"Stop"}}' --type=merge
```

**Dakota lanes and the mutex:** keep the lanes separate.
- `dakota-commit-poller` → `dakota-build-pipeline` (BuildStream publish lane) is expected to run.
- `image-poll-dakota` → `dakota-qa-pipeline` is the active container-only QA lane.
If mutex contention appears, stop stale failed workflows holding `ghost-heavy-compute`; do not
blanket-stop all Dakota build-publish runs or suspend the active QA poller.

### 20a. Dakota BuildStream publish lane output tags

`dakota-build-pipeline` exports the built `oci/bluefin.bst` and `oci/bluefin-nvidia.bst`
artifacts to the local Zot registry. The published tags must match the projectbluefin/dakota
image contract, not internal "cluster testing" names:

- Base variant → `<lab-ip>:30500/dakota:testing`
- NVIDIA variant → `<lab-ip>:30500/dakota-nvidia:testing`

Do not publish these as `:latest` from the cluster lane; `:testing` is the testing-branch
stream and `:stable` is promoted separately from `main`. Keeping the cluster lane on `:testing`
prevents accidental overwrites of the stable/production stream and makes the artifact identity
obvious to downstream lab jobs.

If the template is retagged, update the dashboard fallback writable-repos list in
`src/pages/index.astro` and `src/pages/userspace.astro` to match the new repository names.

### 20b. Dakota verification: use containerized QA when VM path is blocked

Dakota images are built from a composefs-oci backend that declares `bootloader = "systemd"` but
does not ship a UKI. The lab's standard VM QA path (`build-containerdisk` → `bootc install to-disk`
→ KubeVirt VM) therefore fails with `bootupd is required for ostree-based installs` because bootc
1.16.2 bails for systemd-boot ostree installs when no UKI is present. Until Dakota ships a UKI
(or bootc gains a composefs-oci install path), VM-boot verification is blocked.

WorkflowTemplate: `dakota-container-qa-pipeline`

- Runs image-level smoke checks directly inside a pod built from the target OCI image.
- Verifies Dakota identity (`/etc/os-release`), presence of key binaries (`podman`, `flatpak`,
  `gnome-shell`, `bootc`), bootc install config, and valid `bootc status` JSON.
- Requires no `bootc install`, no containerDisk, and no `provision-containerdisk-vm`.
- GUI behave suites (`smoke`/`developer` via `qecore-headless`) cannot run inside a pod because
  `qecore-headless` requires a full systemd/GDM session.

Default invocation for a fresh `dakota:testing` build:

```bash
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/dakota-container-qa-pipeline \
  -p image=<lab-ip>:30500/dakota \
  -p image-tag=testing \
  -p variant=dakota \
  -n argo --watch
```

For `dakota-nvidia:testing`, change only `image` and `variant`:

```bash
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/dakota-container-qa-pipeline \
  -p image=<lab-ip>:30500/dakota-nvidia \
  -p image-tag=testing \
  -p variant=dakota-nvidia \
  -n argo --watch
```

Keep the VM-based `dakota-qa-pipeline` suspended until a successful `build-containerdisk` run
proves the VM-boot path works.

### 22. Per-workflow ephemeral storage — volumeClaimTemplates

### 21. Native-systemd desktop QA

`run-systemd-container-tests` is the container-native desktop QA probe. An
Argo `resource` template creates a privileged target Pod with systemd as PID 1
and a Workflow owner reference; its runner executes qecore inside the target,
never directly under Argo emissary PID 1.

- Keep both target and runner scheduler-driven: no `nodeSelector`, hostPath,
  VMI, raw disk, or containerDisk.
- Use memory-backed `emptyDir` for `/run` and `emptyDir` for `/workspace`. The
  target requests `2 CPU`, `4Gi` memory, and `20Gi` ephemeral storage, with
  limits of `4 CPU`, `8Gi` memory, and `40Gi` ephemeral storage.
- Wait for systemd plus active `dbus` and `systemd-logind` before running
  qecore; print its journal and fail if that state is unavailable.
- Because mounting a new `/run` invalidates the image resolver symlink, copy
  the runner Pod's Kubernetes resolver into the target before Git or pip use.
- Target image pulls through Zot can take up to 600 seconds; size the Argo
  `resource` template timeout accordingly.
- Do not overwrite qecore's desktop session environment with fake `/home`
  runtime-bus values; the real login session D-Bus socket and bus address must
  remain intact.
- Pass test-suite inputs through a durable target file, not environment
  variables: qecore does not forward arbitrary env vars into the desktop
  session.
- Delete the owner-referenced target in the runner's EXIT trap as a prompt
  cleanup fallback.

This runner validates the OCI userspace, systemd/logind startup, resolver
repair, qecore, and GDM bootstrap. Tests requiring a bootloader, kernel,
initramfs, or physical hardware remain outside its scope.

**Not yet the production caller path:** a full smoke suite currently loses its
GNOME D-Bus/Wayland session, so use this probe only for targeted desktop
bootstrap validation until that instability is resolved.

For pipelines that need shared scratch space across steps (e.g. installer binaries, target disks),
use Argo's `volumeClaimTemplates` at the workflow spec level. Argo auto-creates the PVC at workflow
start and auto-deletes it on completion — no manual cleanup step needed.

```yaml
spec:
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: workspace
      spec:
        accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
        storageClassName: local-path   # explicit non-root node mapping in GitOps
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 30Gi

  templates:
    - name: my-step
      script:
        volumeMounts:
          - name: workspace
            mountPath: /mnt/workspace
```

**RWO PVC + KubeVirt VM co-location:** When a VM uses a `persistentVolumeClaim` volume backed
by a RWO PVC, KubeVirt automatically schedules the VM on the same node as the PVC — no explicit
`nodeSelector` needed. Source: /kubevirt/user-guide — "When using local devices or ReadWriteOnce
(RWO) PVCs, affinity rules on VMs sharing storage ensure they are scheduled on the same node."

The local-path provisioner configuration must contain an explicit non-root data
mount for every eligible node. It has no default path: a PVC on an unconfigured
node must fail provisioning rather than write to the root filesystem.

**Namespace constraint:** `volumeClaimTemplates` creates the PVC in the workflow's own namespace
(`argo`). If a VM in a different namespace (`knuckle-test`) needs a disk, create a dedicated PVC
in that namespace via a `resource:` step, and delete it in `onExit`.

```yaml
# registry-lint-ignore not needed — no image ref
- name: create-rootdisk-pvc
  resource:
    action: apply
    manifest: |
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
      metadata:
        name: "{{workflow.name}}-rootdisk"
        namespace: knuckle-test
      spec:
        accessModes: [ReadWriteOnce]
        storageClassName: local-path
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 30Gi
```

**containerDisk OCI format** (source: /kubevirt/user-guide):
```dockerfile
FROM scratch
ADD --chown=107:107 disk.raw /disk/
```
UID 107 = qemu. Required — omitting `--chown` causes VM boot failure (permission denied on disk).

### 23. Log access — Argo is sufficient, no separate stack needed

Argo Server retains all workflow pod logs for the workflow TTL period (7 days success,
30 days failure via `workflow-controller-configmap`). No separate log aggregation stack
(Loki, Promtail, etc.) is needed for a homelab CI cluster.

**Retrieve logs:**
```bash
# most recent workflow
just logs                              # alias: argo logs -n argo @latest

# specific workflow
argo logs -n argo <workflow-name>

# specific pod/container
kubectl logs -n argo <pod> -c main

# via MCP
argo-mcp-logs_workflow <workflow-name>
```

**Why a separate log stack is redundant:**
- Pod logs are already captured and served by the Argo Server
- Artifacts (`results.json`, `atspi_tree.txt`) echo to stderr — accessible via `argo logs`
- Cross-workflow queries → `argo list -n argo` then `argo logs` per workflow
- Adding Loki + Promtail duplicates storage, adds 2–3 pods, and a 10Gi PVC for no
  additional capability that `argo logs` doesn't already provide

### 23. CronWorkflow `suspend` field can survive a git removal — verify live, don't trust ArgoCD "Synced"

Removing `spec.suspend: true` from a CronWorkflow's git manifest and syncing does **not**
reliably clear the live field, even when ArgoCD reports the resource `Synced` and the sync
`operationState` says `Succeeded`. This was observed directly: after removing `suspend: true`
from 10 CronWorkflow manifests, committing, pushing, and force-syncing (`annotate
argocd.argoproj.io/refresh=hard`), ArgoCD reported all 10 as `Synced` — but `kubectl get
cronworkflow <name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.suspend}'` still returned `true` on every one of them.

**Always verify the live field directly after removing it from git — never trust the
ArgoCD sync/resource status alone for boolean fields that may have been set by a prior
apply.** If live state doesn't match git after a confirmed sync, patch it directly:

```bash
kubectl patch cronworkflow -n argo <name> --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"suspend":false}}'
```

Root cause not conclusively identified (suspected Server-Side Apply field-ownership —
a boolean field set by an earlier field manager isn't cleared just because a later
manifest omits it). Treat any boolean/scalar field removal from a CronWorkflow the same
way: confirm live state with `kubectl get -o jsonpath`, don't stop at "ArgoCD says Synced".

### 24. Digest-comparison pollers can't detect out-of-band artifact loss

`digest-watch` (and similarly-shaped pollers) only rebuild an artifact when the **upstream
source digest changes** vs a ConfigMap-stored value. They have no way to notice that the
artifact itself disappeared for an unrelated reason (disk wipe, PVC reset, registry GC)
while the upstream digest stayed the same — the poller will keep reporting "no change,
skipping" indefinitely even though the artifact is gone and every downstream consumer
(e.g. `assert-cd` in a QA pipeline) is failing.

**This happened concretely:** a ghost XFS migration wiped the local Zot registry.
`bluefin-containerdisk` was completely absent, but `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin:testing`'s
digest hadn't changed, so `digest-watch` never rebuilt it. `bluefin-qa-pipeline` would have
failed indefinitely without manual intervention.

**Recovery:** manually submit the build Workflow directly with `force=true`, bypassing the
digest comparison:
```bash
kubectl create -f - <<'EOF'
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: manual-build-cd-<tag>-
  namespace: argo
spec:
  workflowTemplateRef:
    name: build-containerdisk
  arguments:
    parameters:
      - {name: image, value: "ghcr.io/projectbluefin/<repo>"}
      - {name: image-tag, value: "<upstream-tag>"}
      - {name: containerdisk-tag, value: "<zot-tag>"}
      - {name: force, value: "true"}
EOF
```

**Implemented:** digest-comparison pollers that gate a downstream `assert-cd`-style check
now probe the destination registry for artifact existence and force-rebuild the containerDisk
when the artifact is missing or when the upstream source digest changed. This covers disk
wipes, registry migration, and manual Zot cleanup without waiting for a separate recovery
step.

### 25. Configure registries mirror and security policies before running container builds

When running `podman build`, `bootc install`, or other image/pull operations inside a privileged Argo workflow container, you must configure any custom registries mirror files (such as `/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/bluefin-local-zot.conf` to hook up the local Zot pull-through cache) and security policy files (such as `/etc/containers/policy.json`) BEFORE executing those container operations. 

In particular, if the base image being pulled or built has a strict production signature policy built into its `/etc/containers/policy.json` (as is the case with Bluefin/Aurora production images), `bootc install` and other podman/skopeo pull tasks will reject pulling unsigned images from local registries or GHCR with exit code 125 ("Source image rejected: A signature was required, but no signature exists"). Overwriting the pod container's local `/etc/containers/policy.json` with an insecure policy (e.g. `"type": "insecureAcceptAnything"`) prevents this exit-125 failure.

This is extremely critical to understand if a workflow ever uses `hostPID: true`. If a pod using `hostPID: true` exits with failure (or is terminated/timed out), the `argoexec` process teardown signals all processes in its view — which in a host PID namespace means **every host process**, killing host daemons like `k3s`, `sshd`, and `systemd-journald` and crashing the node. Therefore, `hostPID: true` and `hostIPC: true` must NOT be used in build containers. Bypassing signature checks using `policy.json` prevents exit-125 crashes, but removing `hostPID` entirely is the primary safety guarantee.

**Correct order of execution:**
1. Configure containers-storage graphroot.
2. Write registry mirror configuration files under `/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/`.
3. Overwrite `/etc/containers/policy.json` with `insecureAcceptAnything` to bypass signature checks.
4. Run container build or install operations (e.g., `podman build --tls-verify=false -t ...` or `bootc install to-disk ...`).
5. Run container push operations (e.g., `podman push ...`).

### 26. Avoid permission denied errors on /tmp for non-root containers

If an Argo workflow container template is configured to run as a non-root user (such as `runAsUser: 1000` in `run-container-tests.yaml`), and needs to write results, temporary configurations, or scripts under `/tmp`, it can easily fail with `Permission denied` (exit code 1). This happens because `/tmp` inside the bootc rootfs image is typically owned by root with restricted permissions.

The clean, standard Kubernetes/Argo solution is to mount an `emptyDir: {}` volume on `/tmp` inside the pod container. This provides a fresh, fully-writable `/tmp` filesystem that is owned by the executing non-root user (1000) and completely isolates test execution from any image-baked `/tmp` permission constraints.

**Implementation pattern:**
```yaml
    container:
      image: "{{inputs.parameters.image}}:{{inputs.parameters.image-tag}}"
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1000
        runAsGroup: 1000
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /tmp
          name: tmp
    volumes:
      - name: tmp
        emptyDir: {}
```
