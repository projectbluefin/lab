# CI Tooling — GitHub Actions in testing-lab

## When to Use

- Editing `.github/workflows/*.yml`
- Dashboard data is stale, empty, or inconsistent with cluster state
- A workflow needs homelab/private network data
- GitHub Pages shows JSON/JS fetch errors after CI changes

## When NOT to Use

- Argo WorkflowTemplate logic in `argo/workflow-templates/` (use `argo-workflows.md`)
- ArgoCD reconciliation policy work (use `gitops-argocd.md`)
- VM lifecycle/scheduling behavior (use `kubevirt-vms.md`)

## Core Process

1. Confirm runner network model first: GitHub-hosted runners have public internet by default; private network access requires an overlay/VPN setup or a self-hosted runner.
2. For dashboard stats jobs, treat private-cluster snapshots as optional: when live fetch fails, preserve last known live values and set explicit freshness/state flags.
3. Never wipe `recent_runs` or `factory.cluster.nodes` just because a hosted runner cannot reach `192.168.x.x`; preserve and annotate.
4. Add explicit metadata in JSON (`_meta.live_snapshot_ok`, `_meta.refreshed_at`) so UI can show freshness honestly.
5. For GitHub Pages sites, verify the Pages source and build state before assuming a push is live:
   - `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pages --jq '.source'`
   - `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pages/builds/latest --jq '.status'`
   - Pages can legitimately stay in `building` for a while even after the commit is on `main`.
6. If Cloudflare fronts a Pages site, inspect the live HTML for Rocket Loader rewrites (`data-cf-settings`, `type="...-text/javascript"`). Opt the dashboard entry script out with `data-cfasync="false"` when RL rewrites break execution.
7. For dashboard data jobs, confirm the producer workflow published every generated JSON artifact the UI depends on before declaring a section broken; missing data should render an explicit unavailable state rather than disappearing.
8. For browser-side `fetch`, avoid custom request headers that force CORS preflight against GitHub APIs (for example `Cache-Control` request headers).
9. After push, validate production Pages with a real browser render (not raw HTML fetch only): confirm no loading placeholders and key sections render.
10. Any image freshness/status numbers shown in the dashboard must come from GitHub Releases API (`/repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases`) metadata only (`published_at`, `tag_name`, `html_url`). Do not infer release age from Argo run labels or workflow names.
11. For every dashboard number that is not self-evident from local files, publish explicit source lineage (source URL + derivation input) or hide the number as unavailable.
12. For page-owned dashboard JSON (`docs/data/*-status.json`, `*-matrix.json`), keep row-oriented contracts stable: every summary metric and every row gets `source_url`, `collected_at`, `derivation`, plus explicit `state`/`state_reason` fields so later collectors can fill values without redesigning the shape.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "If live fetch fails, clearing fields is safer." | Clearing makes the dashboard lie by omission; preserve last known and mark freshness/state. |
| "Custom `Cache-Control` headers are harmless." | They can trigger CORS preflight and block cross-origin GitHub API fetches. |
| "Raw JSON looks right, so UI is fine." | JS/runtime errors can still break rendering; always validate in a browser. |

## Red Flags

- Workflow writes empty arrays for cluster/runs after transient network failure
- Dashboard shows `Loading…` or stale placeholder rows for long periods
- Live HTML shows Rocket Loader rewriting the dashboard entry script
- Generated dashboard sections disappear because their JSON artifact was not published
- Browser console logs CORS preflight failures to GitHub API endpoints
- CI changes are declared fixed without checking production Pages render
- Image-status ages are derived from workflow/run activity instead of release metadata.
- A dashboard card shows a numeric value without a traceable source URL/evidence path.
- A page-level JSON contract omits row-level provenance or hides missing values by dropping rows.

## Verification

- [ ] Workflow logic preserves last known live snapshot when private endpoint fetch fails
- [ ] `_meta.live_snapshot_ok` and `_meta.refreshed_at` are present and updated
- [ ] GitHub Pages source/build state was checked before declaring a site live
- [ ] If Cloudflare fronts the site, the live HTML keeps the raw dashboard script tag
- [ ] Browser fetch code avoids unnecessary custom headers that trigger preflight
- [ ] Production `https://projectbluefin.github.io/testing-lab/` renders with real table/cluster content (no loading placeholders)
- [ ] Render validation includes a real browser run (headless is fine) and captures evidence
- [ ] Image-status cards derive age from GitHub Releases `published_at` and link to the exact release page (`html_url`).
- [ ] Unsupported metrics (no source-of-truth feed) are hidden or explicitly unavailable, never synthesized.
- [ ] Page-level dashboard JSON keeps stable row keys plus row-level provenance/state fields so collector-only follow-up work can populate data without changing the contract.
