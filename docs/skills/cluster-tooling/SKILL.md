# Cluster Tooling — lab

## When to Use

- Managing cluster state, infra add-ons, registry/cache services, or k8s ops runbooks.
- Debugging BuildStream cache behavior for Dakota/BST workflow lanes.

## When NOT to Use

- Argo WorkflowTemplate authoring details → [`argo-workflows/SKILL.md`](../argo-workflows/SKILL.md).
- KubeVirt VM provisioning → [`kubevirt-vms/SKILL.md`](../kubevirt-vms/SKILL.md).

## Core Process

1. Resolve tool/library docs in Context7 first (kubectl/k3s/BuildStream as needed).
2. Prefer `just` recipes, then `kubectl`/`argo` and other API-driven operations.
   Host-level work is private maintainer maintenance; never use workstation SSH
   to `ghost` or `exo-0` from the public agent path.
3. For BST lanes, configure local and upstream cache fallback in workflow configs:
   - never configure external cache credentials/keys in cluster workflows
   - set `override-project-caches: false` to allow the project's own upstream caches (for example Freedesktop SDK and GNOME OS) to be used as read-only fallbacks, preventing extremely slow, full OS recompilations of basic bootstrap toolchains.
   - point artifact writes at the shared in-cluster Buildbarn frontend (`grpc://frontend.buildbarn.svc.cluster.local:8980`). Persist fetched sources through the paired BuildBarn Remote Asset index (`grpc://bb-remote-asset.buildbarn.svc.cluster.local:8984`, `type: index`) and frontend CAS (`type: storage`), both `push: true`; the external artifact/source cache URLs are read-only fallbacks.
   - keep `source-caches` and `artifacts` populated with the project cache URLs rather than wiping them out; an empty server list forces BuildStream to rebuild bootstrap toolchains locally.
   - when the checkout uses upstream `gnome-build-meta`/`freedesktop-sdk` junctions, mirror their patch queues into the checkout before the build so the cache keys match the upstream remote caches instead of diverging on local patch-set differences.
   - match BuildStream concurrency to live BuildBarn capacity. Dakota uses four
     coordinator fetchers, two builders/pushers for its two one-slot workers,
     and eight jobs per action for the runner CPU limit. Do not serialize a
     healthy distributed build or call cache traffic distributed execution.
4. Validate workflow YAML with `just lint` before push.
5. Confirm live behavior from workflow logs/config output, not assumptions.
6. Never use a root filesystem for persistent workload data or a `hostPath` build
   cache. `manifests/local-path-config.yaml` is the GitOps source for explicit
   node-to-data-mount mappings. It intentionally has no default mapping, so
   PVC provisioning fails on an unconfigured node instead of falling back to
   that node's root disk.

## AMD GPU topology

Both lab nodes are 64 GB Framework Desktop (Strix Halo / Ryzen AI Max+ 395)
machines with an AMD Radeon 8060S iGPU (gfx1151, RDNA 3.5). Each advertises
`amd.com/gpu: 1`.

The `amdgpu-device-plugin` DaemonSet selects nodes via the Node Feature
Discovery label `feature.node.kubernetes.io/pci-0380_1002.present` (AMD display
controller). Do **not** reintroduce the old hand-applied
`lab.projectbluefin.io/amd-gpu` label — it was only ever set on `exo-0`, which
left ghost's GPU unusable for months.

### GPU memory: two ceilings, only one of which you should touch

| Control | Where | Correct value |
|---|---|---|
| BIOS UMA carve-out (`mem_info_vram_total`) | Framework firmware | **minimum (512 MiB)** |
| GTT (`mem_info_gtt_total`) | `ttm.pages_limit` karg | 48 GiB (`12582912` pages) |

`manifests/amdgpu-kargs.yaml` sets the kargs via `rpm-ostree` and annotates each
node `lab.projectbluefin.io/amdgpu-kargs=applied|pending-reboot`. Kargs take
effect only on reboot.

**Do not raise the BIOS carve-out.** It was measured on 2026-08-06 and is a hard
steal from system RAM, not a reallocation — and because GTT is sized from what
remains, raising it makes GPU memory *worse*:

| BIOS UMA | VRAM | MemTotal | GTT |
|---|---|---|---|
| 512 MiB (correct) | 512 MiB | 62.1 GiB | 31.0 GiB → **48 GiB with kargs** |
| 48 GiB (tested, reverted) | 48.0 GiB | **15.4 GiB** | **7.9 GiB** |

At 48 GiB carve-out, Kubernetes saw the node as a 15 GiB machine — too small for
the buildbarn workers, KubeVirt VMs, and KubeStellar control-plane pods it
carries. Minimum carve-out plus a raised `ttm.pages_limit` yields 48 GiB of
GPU-addressable memory *and* keeps all 62 GiB of system RAM.

Note `ttm.page_pool_size` is deliberately unset: it pre-allocates and
permanently removes memory from the OS.

### Verify

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,GPU:.status.allocatable.amd\\.com/gpu,KARGS:.metadata.annotations.lab\\.projectbluefin\\.io/amdgpu-kargs
```

## ROCm inference pause

The local `llm-d` inference workload may be intentionally paused in
`manifests/llm-d.yaml` with `replicas: 0`. Treat that as the expected stopped
state, not a failed deployment. Do not use `kubectl scale` for a durable pause
because ArgoCD self-heal restores the declared state; restore `replicas: 1` in
git to re-enable inference.

That self-heal is fast enough to mislead: a runtime `kubectl scale --replicas=0`
was measured being reverted in **~1 second**, with a replacement pod already
Running. An operator who scales and then checks `kubectl get deploy` sees
`0/1` and concludes it worked.

**The PVC caveat, and when it actually applies.** `manifests/llm-d.yaml` long
carried the opposite advice — scale at runtime, never commit `replicas: 0` —
on the grounds that `llm-d-model-cache` is `local-path`, which is
`WaitForFirstConsumer`, so a PVC with no pod never binds, ArgoCD blocks on it,
and the Deployment is never created. **That deadlock is real but applies only
at first creation.** Once the PVC is `Bound` it stays bound;
`WaitForFirstConsumer` gates the first binding, not the lifetime. So:

| State of `llm-d-model-cache` | Pausing with `replicas: 0` in git |
|---|---|
| `Bound` | Safe — this is the durable pause |
| `Pending` / not yet created | Deadlocks; bring it up at `replicas: 1` first |

Check with `kubectl get pvc -n llm-d` before committing a pause.

If an old ArgoCD operation is still waiting for the pre-pause Deployment,
terminate only that stale operation before syncing the current revision. Remove
only explicitly identified stuck workload pods after the Deployment is scaled
to zero.

## Zot notes

**Zot on-demand sync pulls blobs on tag reads.** Any `skopeo inspect` or pull
of a *tag* through the cache (`192.168.1.102:30501/...`) copies the manifest
AND all blobs from upstream when the digest changed — a digest poll through
zot costs a full multi-GB image, not kilobytes. Digest pollers/watchers must
inspect the upstream registry directly (`skopeo inspect docker://ghcr.io/...`
with `--creds "_token:${GITHUB_TOKEN}"` for ghcr); see
`argo/workflow-templates/image-poller.yaml`.

- Stage Zot authentication separately from activation when anonymous writers
  already exist: commit the htpasswd/Secret contract and auth-ready config,
  migrate every writer, then switch the mounted config and make Secrets required
  in one GitOps rollout. Bump
  each workload's `lab.projectbluefin.io/config-version` annotation when either
  ConfigMap changes because Zot reads the subPath-mounted config only at startup.

## Mandatory first step

Before any kubectl or k3s operation, look up the current API via Context7:

```
resolve-library-id "/k3s-io/k3s" → get-library-docs
```

Do not guess flags or chart schema.

## Tool roles

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| `k3s` | Lightweight Kubernetes — cluster runtime |
| `kubectl` | Direct cluster inspection and apply |
| `zot` | OCI registry for test artifacts |
| `external-secrets` | Pulls secrets from vault into k8s Secrets |

## Common Rationalizations

- "Ghost has 64 GiB, so the build pod will fit."  
  Fitting is not the same as surviving. VM pods use a higher PriorityClass and
  will preempt a `bst-build` pod for memory. The pod gets deleted, the workflow
  retries, and the build never finishes.

- "I will just retry the workflow again."  
  Retries do not change the resource envelope. Fix the requests, limits, and
  concurrency budget, then retry; do not pin the pod to a preferred node.

- "Two variants should build in parallel to save time."  
  Parallel high-memory pods force one onto ghost where it is preempted. The
  wall-clock savings are lost to retries and partial work. Serialize first;
  parallelize only after the cluster has enough dedicated memory capacity.

- "The semaphore already limits concurrency."  
  The `bst-build` semaphore was set to 3, allowing multiple BST lanes to run
  at once. On a two-node lab where each pod requests 14 GiB, that causes
  collisions and preemptions. Set it to 1 and let the scheduler choose among
  nodes that can satisfy the declared requests.

## Red Flags

- `argo get` shows `pod deleted` for a BST build step.
- `kubectl get events --field-selector reason=Preempted` shows BST pods
  displaced by VM pods on `ghost`.
- Two BST build pods are `Running` at the same time with 14 GiB requests each.
- Builds repeatedly fail fast (seconds to a few minutes) without a build error
  in the container logs.
- A Zot sync-prefix change is called verified because `skopeo inspect` timed
  out, or because ArgoCD reports `Synced`, without any
  `zot_repo_downloads_total` evidence.
- A pull failure against the Zot NodePort is reported as a cluster outage
  without first checking whether the workstation is on Tailscale.

## Verification

- [ ] `just lint` passes after any WorkflowTemplate change.
- [ ] ArgoCD reports `Synced` for `lab` after the push.
- [ ] The submitted build pod is scheduler-admitted without a node selector:
      `kubectl get pod -n argo <pod> -o jsonpath='{.spec.nodeName}'` returns
      a Ready node with adequate allocatable resources.
- [ ] `kubectl get configmap -n argo workflow-semaphores` shows
      `bst-build: "1"`.
- [ ] No `Preempted` events appear for the build pod after 10 minutes.
- [ ] The build progresses past source fetches into artifact pulls/builds.
- [ ] Workflow reaches `Succeeded`, or if it fails, the failure is a real build
      error (not `pod deleted`).
- [ ] Authenticated Zot rollouts preserve anonymous pulls, reject anonymous
      writes, and admit the configured writer.
- [ ] After a Zot sync-prefix change, the live DaemonSet shows the new
      `lab.projectbluefin.io/config-version`, and every repository in the
      pre-change `zot_repo_downloads_total` inventory still reports a non-zero
      counter with no error series present.

## GPU inference on Strix Halo (`exo-0`)

`exo-0` is a **64 GB** Framework Desktop (62.1 GiB allocatable), not the 128 GB
box every published Strix Halo guide assumes. Scale all community advice down.

- **Use Vulkan, not ROCm.** On `gfx1151` the Vulkan/RADV backend is the reliable
  llama.cpp path; ROCm is not required for inference. `ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp`
  publishes **no ROCm tags at all** — only `vulkan`, `cuda`, `musa`, `intel`.
- **Vision models on Vulkan must be CNNs.** The vs-mlrt `vsncnn` backend converts
  ONNX through ncnn, whose converter covers only a **subset** of operators.
  Swin-style attention is outside it: `SwinIR-M x2` fails with `Unsupported slice
  step`, `Cast not supported yet`, `Unknown data type 0`. That rules out the whole
  transformer family — SwinIR, SCUNet, DAT, HAT, RGT, DRCT, ATD, OmniSR, waifu2x
  `swin_unet_*`. Filter candidates to SPAN / Compact (SRVGGNet) / ESRGAN (RRDB)
  **before** downloading weights; the SwinIR archive alone is 1.1 GB. This is a
  backend property, not a per-model bug.
- **The 48 GiB GTT ceiling is not a budget.** GTT is system RAM shared with
  BuildBarn, KubeVirt and KubeStellar. amdgpu GTT pins pages the OOM-killer
  cannot reclaim, so overcommitting deadlocks the node rather than evicting a pod.
- **`kubectl top` cannot measure GPU memory here.** Measured: `top node` reported
  8% while 26.5 GiB was resident in GTT. Read
  `/sys/class/drm/card*/device/mem_info_gtt_used` instead.
- **MoE beats dense ~6-12x.** The node is bandwidth-bound (~85 GB/s
  host-to-device), so *active* parameters set decode speed. A 30B-A3B MoE
  measured 70-74 tok/s at Q6_K; a dense 32B manages ~11 tok/s.
- **Tensor parallelism over the USB4 link is dead.** ~128 collectives/token x
  70-100 us = 9-13 ms/token of stall. Independently measured elsewhere as ~15%
  *slower* than single-node. The link helps load time, not decode.
- **`-fa on` and no-mmap (`--load-mode none`) are mandatory** on Strix Halo.
- **`amdgpu.lockup_timeout=20000`** prevents a spurious "device lost" GPU reset
  that kills long generations; the ~10s default is a desktop tuning. Needs a
  reboot — check the `lab.projectbluefin.io/amdgpu-kargs` node annotation.
- Never raise the BIOS UMA carve-out above its 512 MiB minimum; it steals system
  RAM and *shrinks* GTT.

Two cluster-specific traps that cost real time:

- **Digest-pinned images cannot be pulled.** Node pulls go through the zot mirror
  (`override_path = true`, no upstream fallback) and zot's on-demand sync only
  triggers on *tag* references. A bare `@sha256:` for an uncached image 404s.
  Pin to an immutable per-build tag instead.
- **`replicas: 0` + a `WaitForFirstConsumer` PVC deadlocks ArgoCD.** The PVC
  cannot bind without a pod, ArgoCD blocks its sync waiting for PVC health, and
  so the Deployment is never created at all. Scale at runtime instead of
  committing `replicas: 0`.
- **TSO on `thunderbolt0` destroys cross-node pod traffic — turn it off.**
  Measured 2026-08-21: pod->pod `10.42.x` throughput was **244 KB/s** with TSO
  on and **379 MB/s** with it off, a ~1,550x collapse from a **15% TCP
  retransmit rate** (`RetransSegs 30525 / OutSegs 201734`). The link carried
  90.4 MB to deliver a 33.5 MB payload. **Only forwarded traffic is affected** —
  host-locally-generated traffic over the same link always did 1.10 GB/s, which
  is why raw link tests look healthy and hide the bug entirely. flannel runs
  `host-gw` here, so every cross-node pod flow is forwarded and hits this path.
  `gso` and `gro` were measured individually and are innocent; leave them on.
  Reconciled every 15 s by the `usb4-link-monitor` DaemonSet, because `ethtool`
  state is not persisted by NetworkManager and resets on reboot. Issue #662.
- **Read TCP stats in the *sending pod*, not on the host.** `/proc/net/snmp` is
  per-netns, so a host-side read shows a healthy stack while the pod is
  retransmitting 15% of its segments. Pair it with per-interface byte counters
  read on the **receiving** side to spot amplification.
- **`ip route get <peer-pod-ip>` must run in the host netns** (a
  `hostNetwork: true` pod). Inside a pod it always answers
  `via <cni0 gateway> dev eth0`, because interface selection happens on the
  host — so the in-pod check "confirms" USB4 while proving nothing.

## Common Rationalizations

- "It only touches cache config, no lint needed." → Wrong; run `just lint` for every workflow YAML change.
- "Project defaults are fine." → Wrong for this lab; project-defined remotes can re-enable external cache push paths.
- "Port 443 refused means cache host down." → Wrong; validate actual BST ports (`11001`/`11002`) and latency behavior.

## Red Flags

- BuildStream configs setting `override-project-caches: true` for pipelines that depend on upstream bootstrap artifacts (like Freedesktop SDK and GNOME OS meta), causing extremely slow and completely cold builds of the entire OS.
- Any BST lane includes external cache host URLs in generated config.
- Docs describe local-first but YAML still allows project cache remotes.

## Verification

- [ ] Workflow templates align `override-project-caches` to `false` for base fallback coverage.
- [ ] No external cache host appears in relevant workflow YAML/scripts.
- [ ] `just lint` passes after edits.
- [ ] Skill content reflects the current shared Buildbarn cache policy.
