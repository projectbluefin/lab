# Dakota PR Review — lab Skill

## When to Use

- Reviewing a PR in `projectbluefin/dakota`
- Deciding whether a Dakota PR is mergeable from the lab side
- Triaging a Dakota PR that failed, stalled, or never got a lab run

## When NOT to Use

- Reviewing non-Dakota repositories → `ci-tooling.md` or `argo-workflows.md`
- Merging a PR directly without a linked lab run
- Reworking the Dakota build pipeline itself → `argo-workflows.md`

---

## Core Process

Dakota PR review is a lab-backed admission process. GitHub Actions status is advisory when the repository's known CI/merge-queue path is broken; the lab result is the merge gate for this workflow.

1. Confirm the PR number, target branch, head SHA, and that it is still open and mergeable.
2. Do not treat `pr/needs-review`, `automerge`, or `chore/deps` labels as approval. Verify maintainer approval when the repository policy requires it.
3. Request or dispatch on-demand SHA-pinned lab validation via validation class `dakota-bst-qa` (using `dakota-validation` dispatch via GitHub Actions if cluster credentials are not available, or `just dakota-validate-request <pr> <sha>`).
4. Build the exact PR head SHA with `dakota-build-pipeline` in distributed (`re`) mode, followed by `dakota-qa-pipeline` for containerized acceptance suites.
5. Keep each build serialized by the `bst-build` semaphore. Never start competing Dakota BST builds; queue them and process one PR at a time. Active requests for the same SHA are automatically deduped.
6. Capture Argo workflow names, exact SHAs, build mode, test result, and failure logs. A pass must be tied to the same commit that will be merged.
7. If build and E2E pass, recheck the PR head and mergeability, then merge directly. Do not use GitHub merge queue for this process: queue promotion has historically evaluated the wrong/stale commit when GHA is failing.
8. If lab validation fails, do not merge. Classify infrastructure failures separately from source/test failures and rerun only after the blocker is fixed.

## Merge Policy

- The lab is authoritative for this operator flow when Dakota GHA checks are known to fail for unrelated CI or merge-queue reasons.
- Direct merge is allowed only after the exact PR SHA has a successful distributed build and successful required lab E2E/smoke coverage.
- Merge the current head only; if the PR changes after testing, discard the evidence and rerun.
- Do not merge a PR with an unresolved source/test failure, a stale result, or an infrastructure run that never reached the test phase.
- Keep one active Dakota build at a time; QA workflows may run concurrently only when they do not contend for the BST build semaphore.

## Operator Flow

1. List open Dakota PRs and group them by base branch; process oldest/queue-ready first.
2. For each PR, inspect the current head SHA and changed paths, then dispatch the distributed build from the exact branch/ref.
3. Wait for `dakota-build-pipeline` to complete. A parent workflow marked successful with failed child nodes is not a clean pass; inspect the node summary and logs.
4. Run `dakota-container-qa-pipeline` against the built local registry image. Run the full `dakota-qa-pipeline` suites when the PR needs GUI/BDD coverage.
5. Record pass/fail evidence and stop on infrastructure failures such as BuildBarn storage/DNS or worker loss; recover the lab before retrying.
6. On a clean pass, re-read the PR head SHA, confirm it remains mergeable, and merge directly rather than entering merge queue.
7. After merge, verify the merge commit and watch the next build/publish workflow; do not report success merely because the merge API accepted the operation.

## Repair Loop

When lab validation exposes a fixable issue in the PR itself, repair the PR instead of merely reporting failure:

1. Confirm the failure is caused by the PR and is within its stated scope; do not absorb unrelated cleanup.
2. Check out the PR branch, make the smallest source fix, and add or update a regression test when practical.
3. Run the lightest local checks first, then push the fix to the PR branch with a clear commit message. Never force-push or rewrite contributor history.
4. Re-read the PR head SHA after the push and rerun the distributed build from that new SHA.
5. Run the image smoke and required E2E suites against the rebuilt image. Old lab evidence is invalid after a PR change.
6. If the repaired PR passes, merge the PR directly using the fresh head SHA; if it fails, leave it open with the exact source/test blocker.
7. Record the repair, test workflow names, and merge result in the operator handoff; do not post duplicate status comments when the PR UI already shows the state.

A repair is appropriate for a localized build recipe, element, workflow, or test defect that the PR is clearly responsible for. Stop and ask for human direction for design changes, security-sensitive changes, cross-repo API changes, or fixes that expand the PR's purpose.

## Known Lab Lessons

- The `dakota-pr-import-poller` historically watched `test-on-lab`, while the active Dakota queue uses `clanker-queue`; inspect the live poller/template before assuming labels will dispatch work.
- A Dakota image may have an empty OCI `Cmd`. `run-container-tests` must pass `/sbin/init` explicitly after the image reference or crun fails before systemd starts.
- BuildBarn storage/worker DNS or disappearance errors are infrastructure failures, not PR failures. Confirm storage StatefulSet pods, frontends, scheduler, workers, and the `bst-build` semaphore before retrying.
- A successful Argo parent can hide failed child build nodes. Read the node summary and logs.
- GitHub merge queue is not the merge path for this operator flow when GHA is failing; direct merge follows fresh lab evidence and an exact-SHA recheck.

## Red Flags

- No linked Dakota workflow for a PR that is otherwise ready to merge
- Workflow fails before the Dakota tests run
- Workflow logs contain authenticated command lines, token-bearing variables, or unredacted API output
- A routine Renovate label is treated as maintainer approval
- Operator report lacks evidence or a workflow link
- PR is merged while the latest lab run is still failing or missing

## Verification

- [ ] PR head SHA, base branch, mergeability, and approval state were verified
- [ ] Distributed `dakota-build-pipeline` passed for the exact PR SHA
- [ ] Dakota smoke/E2E workflow passed for the resulting image
- [ ] BuildBarn and Argo child nodes were checked; no hidden failed nodes remain
- [ ] Workflow logs were checked for secret redaction before linking them
- [ ] If the PR was repaired, the fix was pushed to the PR branch and tested from its new head SHA
- [ ] If merged, the merge was direct (not merge queue) and the post-merge workflow was checked
