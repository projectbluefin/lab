# GitOps / ArgoCD — testing-lab Skill

## When to Use

- Adding a new WorkflowTemplate (which git path? ArgoCD managed or bootstrap?)
- Debugging "my template change isn't showing up in the cluster"
- Adding a new CronWorkflow or manifest
- Understanding why ArgoCD reverted a manual change
- Setting up the repo on a new cluster

## When NOT to Use

- Argo Workflows YAML authoring → `argo-workflows.md`
- VM provisioning failures → `kubevirt-vms.md`

## Core Process

### 1. Two ArgoCD Applications — know which owns what

| Application | Git path | Namespace | What it manages |
|---|---|---|---|
| `testing-lab` | `argo/workflow-templates/` | argo | WorkflowTemplates |
| `testing-lab-infra` | `manifests/` | argo + others | CronWorkflows, RBAC, NodePorts, ConfigMaps |

Both use `automated: { prune: true, selfHeal: true }` — per
[Argo CD best practices](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/auto_sync/).

**`prune: true`** — resources removed from git are deleted from the cluster.
**`selfHeal: true`** — manual cluster changes are reverted within ~3 minutes.

### 2. The three-path decision tree

```
New file to add to the repo?
        │
        ├─ Runs every pipeline / changes regularly?
        │   └─ → argo/workflow-templates/   (ArgoCD managed, tested in CI)
        │
        ├─ Runs once to set up the cluster?
        │   └─ → argo/bootstrap/            (NOT ArgoCD managed, apply manually)
        │
        └─ Cluster infrastructure (CronWorkflow, RBAC, NodePort, ConfigMap)?
            └─ → manifests/                 (ArgoCD managed via testing-lab-infra)
```

### 3. The deploy loop

```bash
# Edit a WorkflowTemplate
vim argo/workflow-templates/my-template.yaml

# Lint before committing
argo lint --offline argo/workflow-templates/

# Commit and push — ArgoCD polls or webhooks within ~3 minutes
git add . && git commit -m "feat(templates): ..." && git push

# Force sync if you can't wait
just argocd-sync

# Verify
just argocd-status
```

**Never:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f argo/workflow-templates/my-template.yaml   # ✗ ArgoCD reverts this
argo template create argo/workflow-templates/my-template.yaml  # ✗ same
```

### 4. Bootstrap templates — manual, not GitOps

`argo/bootstrap/` is intentionally **outside** all ArgoCD Applications. These templates
are applied once during cluster setup and left in the cluster as runnable runbooks:

```bash
# Apply all bootstrap templates (once, during cluster setup)
kubectl apply -f argo/bootstrap/ -n argo

# Or just one:
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/install-kubevirt -n argo --wait --log
```

If you add a template to `argo/bootstrap/` and push to main, ArgoCD does nothing —
you must still apply it manually.

### 5. manifests/ uses ServerSideApply

`manifests/` has `ServerSideApply: true` in the ArgoCD Application. This means
manifests **patch** resources rather than replace them. You can add a single key to
a Helm-managed ConfigMap without owning the whole object.

**Consequence:** `generateName:` is forbidden in `manifests/` — ArgoCD needs stable
names to track resources. Always use a fixed `name:`.

### 6. Sync status and forced sync

```bash
# Check status
just argocd-status
# or
argocd app get testing-lab
argocd app get testing-lab-infra

# Force sync
just argocd-sync
# or
argocd app sync testing-lab testing-lab-infra --timeout 120
```

If a template change is in git but not yet live:
1. Check `argocd app get testing-lab` — is it Synced?
2. If OutOfSync, run `just argocd-sync`
3. If sync fails, check ArgoCD logs: `kubectl logs -n argocd -l app.kubernetes.io/name=argocd-application-controller`

### 7. OCI Helm chart Applications (arc-systems, arc-runners)

ArgoCD can deploy OCI Helm charts directly. These Applications live under `argocd/`
and are applied once as control-plane resources (not GitOps-managed by ArgoCD itself).

```bash
# Apply ARC ArgoCD Applications (one-time, or after cluster rebuild)
kubectl apply -f argocd/arc-controller-app.yaml -n argocd
kubectl apply -f argocd/arc-runners-app.yaml -n argocd
```

**CRD annotation size limit** — Large CRDs (e.g. `autoscalingrunnersets.actions.github.com`)
exceed ArgoCD's 262KB client-side annotation limit. Fix: `ServerSideApply=true` in
`syncOptions`. Already set in `argocd/arc-controller-app.yaml`.

**Stuck retry loop** — if ArgoCD retries a failed sync with stale syncOptions:
```bash
kubectl patch application <name> -n argocd \
  --type=json -p='[{"op":"remove","path":"/operation"}]'
kubectl annotate application <name> -n argocd \
  argocd.argoproj.io/refresh=hard --overwrite
```

**Controller service account discovery** — `gha-runner-scale-set` discovers the
controller SA by label lookup. Fails when controller and runners are in different
namespaces. Always set explicitly in helm values:
```yaml
controllerServiceAccount:
  namespace: arc-systems
  name: arc-systems-gha-rs-controller
```

**bazzite scheduling** — bazzite is fully schedulable (no taint); k3s-agent is enabled at boot.
When bazzite is online it can accept workflow pods. If a pod lands on bazzite and fails,
delete it — it will reschedule to ghost automatically.

### 9. Suspending a broken CronWorkflow permanently

When a CronWorkflow always fails (upstream image broken, build blocked), suspend it **in git**
— a `kubectl patch` will be reverted by ArgoCD selfHeal within ~3 minutes.

```yaml
# In manifests/<name>.yaml — add spec.suspend: true
spec:
  suspend: true       # ArgoCD enforces this; removes it to re-enable
  schedules:
    - "0 * * * *"
```

Commit and push. ArgoCD sets the CronWorkflow's suspend flag and stops scheduling new runs.

**Suspend vs delete:** temporarily broken → suspend. Permanently abandoned → delete the file; ArgoCD prune removes the CronWorkflow.

**Currently suspended:** `image-poll-dakota` — dakota composefs image ships no UKI;
`bootc install to-disk` always fails. Do not un-suspend until upstream ships a UKI or
the pipeline switches to golden-disk.

### 10. Reconciling orphan templates (cluster-only → git)

When a template exists in the cluster but not in git:
```bash
# Export and clean metadata
kubectl get workflowtemplate -n argo <name> -o json \
  | python3 -c "
import json,sys,yaml
d=json.load(sys.stdin)
for k in ['resourceVersion','uid','creationTimestamp','generation','managedFields']:
    d['metadata'].pop(k,None)
d.pop('status',None)
print(yaml.dump(d,default_flow_style=False,sort_keys=False))" \
  > argo/workflow-templates/<name>.yaml
```

Then lint, commit, push. ArgoCD will adopt the resource on next sync.

### 9. Taking GitOps ownership of unmanaged Deployments/Services

When a Deployment or Service exists in the cluster but has no manifest in git (e.g. was created
with `kubectl apply` or a Helm one-shot and then forgotten), ArgoCD will not manage or prune it
unless you add a manifest.

Pattern:
1. Inspect the running resource: `kubectl get deploy <name> -n <ns> -o yaml`
2. Strip generated fields (`resourceVersion`, `uid`, `creationTimestamp`, `managedFields`, `status`)
3. Write the clean manifest to `manifests/<name>.yaml`
4. Commit and push. ArgoCD SSA will take ownership on next sync without restarting the pod (if the spec is identical).
5. **Name the Deployment and Service identically to the existing resource** — SSA patches in place rather than recreating.

> ⚠️ If you change the image or spec while adopting, ArgoCD will roll the pod. Safe for stateless
> workloads; for stateful ones (writable registries, DBs) verify data path continuity first.

### 10. Verify live state before reporting — the four-step check

After pushing a fix and forcing sync, **always** verify the live template before
reporting the fix is deployed or resubmitting a workflow:

```bash
# 1. Confirm git push landed
git log -1 origin/main -- <file>

# 2. Confirm ArgoCD synced the revision
just argocd-status   # both apps: Synced + Healthy

# 3. Confirm the live template has your change
argo-mcp-get_workflow_template name=<template> namespace=argo
# grep for the exact changed value — don't assume

# 4. Submit NEW workflow (templates snapshot at submit time)
# A workflow submitted before step 3 runs the OLD template
```

Reporting "fix deployed" after steps 1-2 only — without step 3 — is a false report.
Submitting a workflow before step 3 wastes a run on the old bug.

This protocol was established after multiple sessions where:
- A fix was pushed and ArgoCD appeared synced, but a field manager conflict meant
  the live Deployment still had the old value
- A new workflow was submitted immediately after push but before ArgoCD synced,
  running the stale template for the full pipeline duration

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll apply it manually just this once." | selfHeal: true will revert it within minutes. Use git. |
| "It's in bootstrap/ so ArgoCD won't prune it from the cluster." | Correct — but you still have to `kubectl apply -f argo/bootstrap/ -n argo` to put it there. |
| "I pushed to a feature branch — why isn't it live?" | Both Applications track `main`. Feature branch changes don't sync. |
| "The diff looks right in `argocd app diff`." | Diff shows desired vs actual. Sync makes it actual. |

## Red Flags

- A Deployment or Service running in the cluster with no corresponding manifest in `manifests/` — it is invisible to ArgoCD, will not be pruned or healed, and drifts silently (e.g. `registry:2` ran unmanaged for 18+ days)
- A WorkflowTemplate in `argo/workflow-templates/` that exists only in the cluster (not in git) — ArgoCD will prune it on next sync
- `generateName:` in any file under `manifests/`
- A template that was `kubectl apply`d and is showing as OutOfSync in ArgoCD
- Bootstrap templates accidentally placed in `argo/workflow-templates/` (ArgoCD will prune them if removed from git)
- Reporting a fix as deployed without verifying `argo-mcp-get_workflow_template` shows the new value live
- Submitting a new workflow immediately after a push without waiting for ArgoCD sync confirmation
- **Using `registry.access.redhat.com` (UBI) or `bitnami/*` images** — both banned in this cluster. Use `cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base:latest` instead.
- **Choosing a base image without checking the policy** — preference order is: `cgr.dev/chainguard/*` first, then ask. Fedora images are allowed when appropriate (not replaced with non-existent alternatives). docker.io is banned except `docker.io/rocm/k8s-device-plugin` (annotate `# registry-lint-ignore`).

## Image Policy

**Preference order (enforced by `just lint` registry allowlist):**

1. `cgr.dev/chainguard/*` — default choice for all infra/tooling images
2. For anything else: **ask the user** — do not assume distros
3. Fedora images are allowed when appropriate for Fedora/CoreOS-specific tooling
4. Banned: `registry.access.redhat.com` (UBI), `bitnami/*`, `docker.io/*` (except `docker.io/rocm/k8s-device-plugin` with `# registry-lint-ignore`)

**Critical Chainguard tag facts:**
- `cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base:latest` ✅ (has apk, nsenter, full tooling)
- `cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base:latest-dev` ❌ DOES NOT EXIST
- `cgr.dev/chainguard/kubectl:latest-dev` ✅ (has bash; `:latest` is distroless — no shell)
- `cgr.dev/chainguard/kubectl:latest` ❌ no bash — use `latest-dev` for steps that need shell

**Zot pull-through cache — 6 upstreams (as of 2026):**

| Upstream | NodePort path prefix |
|---|---|
| `ghcr.io` | `:30501/ghcr` |
| `docker.io` | `:30501/docker` |
| `quay.io` | `:30501/quay` |
| `registry.fedoraproject.org` | `:30501/fedora` |
| `registry.k8s.io` | `:30501/k8s` |
| `cgr.dev` | `:30501/cgr` |

All images in `argo/` and `manifests/` must use a registry from the allowlist in `.github/workflows/lint.yaml`.

## Verification

Before merging a GitOps change:

- [ ] No Deployment or Service in `local-registry`, `argo`, or other managed namespaces exists only in the cluster — verify with `kubectl get deploy,svc -n <ns>` vs git
- [ ] New WorkflowTemplate is in the correct path (`workflow-templates/` vs `bootstrap/`)
- [ ] `argo lint --offline argo/workflow-templates/` passes
- [ ] No `generateName:` in `manifests/`
- [ ] Pushed to `main` (not a feature branch)
- [ ] After push: `just argocd-status` shows both Applications as `Synced` and `Healthy`
- [ ] `argo-mcp-get_workflow_template name=<template> namespace=argo` confirms the exact changed value is live (not just that sync completed)
- [ ] Any new workflow submitted AFTER the above two checks pass
