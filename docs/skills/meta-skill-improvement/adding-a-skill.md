# Adding a New Skill

## When to add a skill

Create a new skill when a domain keeps needing the same explanations, checklists,
or troubleshooting steps, and the existing skill surface does not cover it clearly.
Do not create a skill for one-off tasks.

## Creating the skill

1. Copy the template:
   ```bash
   cp docs/skills/_template/SKILL.md docs/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
   ```
2. Fill in the frontmatter `name` and `description`.
3. Replace the bracketed guide text with concrete rules, process steps, and
   verification checklists.
4. Keep `SKILL.md` under 300 lines. Extract deep-dive sections to sibling
   `.md` files if the skill needs more detail.
5. Add the skill to `docs/skills/README.md`.
6. If the skill is part of the standard agent routing table, add a row to
   `agents.md` as well.

## When NOT to add a skill

- A one-off task that will not recur.
- A generic development practice already covered by `/agents.md` or external docs.
- A personal preference that does not reflect a team-wide convention.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll document this later." | Later rarely happens; the skill lives beside the work or not at all. |
| "A README section is enough." | A README explains *what*; a skill explains *when and how* to act. |
| "Only I need to know this." | The next agent will need it too. |

## Red Flags

- Skills with no `## When to Use` trigger.
- Skill files that are logs of past incidents instead of timeless procedure.
- No `## Verification` checklist at the end of a skill.

## Verification

- [ ] Skill has a clear, actionable `description` in frontmatter.
- [ ] `SKILL.md` is under 300 lines, or oversized sections are split into sibling files.
- [ ] Skill includes `## When to Use`, `## When NOT to Use`, `## Core Process`, `## Common Rationalizations`, `## Red Flags`, and `## Verification`.
- [ ] Skill is listed in `docs/skills/README.md`.
- [ ] `python3 scripts/validate-docs.py` passes without errors.

Run the docs validator before committing:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate-docs.py
```

It checks skill frontmatter, internal links, forbidden patterns, and line budgets.
