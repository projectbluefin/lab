//! User namespace utilities for rootless containers-storage access.
//!
//! This module provides utilities for determining when user namespace entry is
//! needed to access overlay storage files that are owned by remapped UIDs/GIDs.
//!
//! # Background
//!
//! When podman runs rootless, it uses user namespaces to remap UIDs. Files in
//! the overlay storage are owned by these remapped UIDs (e.g., UID 100000+N on
//! the host corresponds to UID N inside the container). These files also retain
//! their original permission bits from the container image.
//!
//! Files with restrictive permissions (e.g., `/etc/shadow` with mode 0600) are
//! only readable by their owner - a remapped UID we cannot access as an
//! unprivileged user.
//!
//! # Solution
//!
//! Rather than manually setting up user namespaces (parsing `/etc/subuid`,
//! calling `newuidmap`/`newgidmap`, etc.), we delegate to `podman unshare`
//! which handles all the edge cases. See [`crate::userns_helper`] for the
//! helper process that runs inside the user namespace.

/// Check if the current process can read arbitrary files regardless of permissions.
///
/// This returns `true` if:
/// - The process is running as real root (UID 0), or
/// - The process has `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` in its effective capability set
///
/// When this returns `true`, there's no need to spawn a userns helper for
/// file access - the process can already read any file in the storage.
